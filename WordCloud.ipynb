              "      <th>hello do inaudible yes sir don't you hurt him okay fine yes sir    okay guys so I think in last class so I    was talking about up and dodge right do    not kill yourself um okay fine so in    this class I am going to talk about a    number package    okay fine guys so I think in last class    so I was talking about a pandas and we    have discussed many things in terms of a    pandas so in this class I will talk    about like what is numpy and what is the    uses of Mumbai package and what kind of    our data will be able to handle inside    of numpy so let's try to understand that    what is a number first of all so I'll    try to do an import over here so import    nu MV y as n V so here you will be able    to find out that I am trying to import    this uh numpy any MP wine so it's    nothing but a numerical Python so in    your means numerical and PI means Python    basically so this numpy was not    available inside a Python package or as    a part of a Python package I would say    so basically there is a tool I would say    a call as a Matt Hartley it's not a like    a like a MATLAB basically so there was a    tool called as a MATLAB not a Matt    product Matt Burnham is basically a    library for a visualization so MATLAB is    a tool which has been used for our    different different kind of a simulation    or different different kind of a    software testing or different kind of a    neural network as well so before like    like a five-year bag or 10 year back so    people have been using and even when I    was in my college life so I was trying    to write some kind of a paper at that    point of a time so even I have used a    MATLAB so metal app as a tool to build a    neural impulse so because at that point    of a time there was a notice of flow    there most are no firearms he knows or    cafe which was available as open source    so fine so basically that was our    numerical package which was available    inside like like MATLAB and what people    have done is so they have just    replicated the entire package inside a    Python same numerical package they have    duplicated over here keeping these    things in our mind that if we are trying    to do a signal processing or if we are    trying to do our email processing or if    we are trying to do any kind of a text    data processing as well so generally    system will be expecting a kind of array    or kind of a matrixes so unless and    until you will not be able to convert    your data in a form of arrays or in a    form of a matrixes you will not be able    to perform those kind of operations so    numpy is basically a numerical Python    package fear you will    dealing with majorly an array order    matrixes or mostly array because matrix    is a subclass of array itself so again    we have going to talk about like a    different different kind of operations    or different different kind of a data    manipulation with respect to a number    package plus a data conversion as well    so numpy package just understand arrays    or our matrixes and like I told you in a    very beginning that there is no such    array concept which exists inside a core    Python and yes that is true so far so    forth we have not seen even a single    array element in our discussion so there    is a list element which is available but    there is no array element which is    available so like I told you that term    this array kind of an element is    available inside a numpy and let's try    to discuss about that let's try to build    our understanding so here I am just    trying to import numpy because by    default this number libraries will not    be available in your current import or    in your current session once you are    going to import it after that for sure    it will be available so yes it is    allowed it's available and NP is nothing    but it's just a alias which I have given    so you can try to keep my name or you    can try to give your name doesn't matter    at all so it's just an abbreviation of a    numpy which I am trying to like take in    this particular place now what I will do    is let's suppose if I'm going to create    a list let's suppose a is a list and    then inside manage I have a 3 comma 4    comma 5 comma 6 this is the data now as    we know that if I am going to check a    type of this data so it is going to give    me basically a list of data it's come    really fine now what we can do and above    this one is so if I have to convert this    data into a array form it into our numpy    compatible array format so in that case    I can try to call NP which is nothing    but an alias of a numpy like we were    using alias for a fantasic is equal to    PD and then numpy dot a double are a    wide I can try to type over here and I    can try to give a value is equal to a    means I'm trying to pass list inside a    numpy not array if I am going to execute    it it's completely fine you will be able    to see our notation as an array over    here so this is a notation of a array    that you will be able to see so I have    converted    list into a any format in this way now    so here if I'll try to check a data type    of this one typ of this one so it's    basically a nd array so you will be able    to find out that it's a numpy compatible    n dimensional array so ndre means n    dimensional array it is trying to build    it for me so it's completely fine so I'm    able to build a array out of my data set    now what we are going to do is so now I    will be showing you our different    different kind of manipulation so here    it's a very basic thing like you will    take an array and then even take a list    and then you will be able to convert    those lists in terms of aw or in a form    of arrays it's completely fine plus what    we can do is so let's suppose if I am    going to take a list where I have a    integer and I have a floating-point    number    now what will happen if I am going to    take an integer so I have a 3 4 5 6 as    an integer and then then I have 1 so I    have basically a floating point number    over here now if I am going to execute    it it's completely fine    you will be able to see some kind of    changes in your output you will be able    to find out that it is trying to perform    up casting it is trying to perform up    casting automatically so we had just    three but it has converted these things    into three dot means a floating one    number so finally it has converted    everything into a floating one number    this is called a saw up casting so if    you are going to take some element    inside an umpire taught some element    inside and list as a floating point    number and if a rest of the element is    available into an integer by default    whenever you will try to convert your    data into an array it will try to    perform a AB casting this is something    which is going to happen by default you    don't have any control over to it again    in a later stage you will be able to do    a typecasting and you will be able to    convert all of your like a floating    point number into integer that is    possible but here so by default it will    be able to up cast your data set again    otherwise if I can talk about so NP dot    a double are a while and maybe I can try    to pass unless Ted list over here so I    can try to pass a list of a list over    here so this is a list    like that I have 1 comma 2 comma 3 and I    have another list let's suppose so I    have another list and in this list let's    suppose I have a 3 comma 4 comma 5 if    I'm going to execute it so again it has    converted my data into a array inside    array so basically I have two array    inside one single array this is how you    will be able to understand it so I have    an outer array and inside that I mean I    have a to array or if you will try to    understand in a layman way you can try    to understand in this way that here so    we have 0 1 2 and here we have 0 1 so we    have to row and we have 3 columns let's    suppose if I have to access this element    so how I will be able to access this    element if I'm going in to give a    coordinate or if I'm going to give like    indexes of 0 0 I will be able to access    1 if I'm going to act like a give 0 1 I    will be able to access this one this is    how you are supposed to understand on    numpy array or n dimensional array so    let's try to do it and let's try to    understand it so let's suppose I am    going to stall is store this particular    value inside a variable called as B and    this is V is nothing but this one now if    I am going to write V of V of 0 then I    will be able to get this entirely first    element V of 0 means zeroth row I am    able to access now if I am going to give    V of 0 of 0 this is what we have    discussed so far sure you will be able    to get this one 0 of 1 so this one 0 of    2 this one so this is how you will be    able to get a data you will be able to    access a data from numpy array so if you    have a multi-dimensional array this is    how I will be able to access a data    apart from that apart from that so if I    will try to check if I'll try to check V    dot as such ap safe of V now what is the    meaning of safe safe means number of Rho    and number of columns so safe is a    inbuilt function which is available    inside a numpy so suppose if I'm going    to call shape of this data this    pertinent data so as we know that we    have a tube we have two row so that's    the reason we are able to get to this    one and this one and we have basically    three columns so we are able to get    these three as simple as that so this is    what safe is going to return and this    concepts are very basic but at the same    point of a time    a significance of this concepts are very    much high one once you will try to    process your images or maybe some kind    of sensor data some kind of a textual    data into our deep learning with the    help of a neural network or even into a    machine learning you will be able to    understand that in a core in a heart of    each and every processing so it is    trying to convert everything into a    numerical array format or a number array    format and then it is trying to process    it so again so some time it is going to    give you some kind of a shape issue or    some time it is going to give you some    kind of a format issue    so unless and until you don't know an    umpire in a better way you will not be    able to debug all of those things so    fine guys I am able to get a safe over    here now what I will try to do is so B    dot R dim I can try to execute or let's    suppose I am going to create one array    so in B dot a double are a Y array and    then inside that so maybe I can try to    keep some kind of an element so if I am    going to execute it this is the simple    array which I am able to get now if I    look into this array function you will    be able to find out that number of    dimension which is given dimension is    given over here so by default dimension    will be equal to 0 now let's suppose if    I wanted to keep dimension so ending is    equal to so ending is equal to let's    suppose if I am going to give two now    what will happen in that particular case    let's try to understand it sometime so    it's completely fine if I am going to    give dimension is equal to two so in    that case you will be able to find out    that it is trying to give me to bracket    over here it is going to give me into    bracket over here this is what happens    in case of a number of dimension is    equal to two now let's suppose if I am    going to give a dimension is equal to 20    you will be able to find out that it is    replaced at 20 bracket before and 20    bracket after whenever you will try to    do image processing these    things are very much important because    if I'll talk about a matrix    multiplication because this is what    happens in general into a new liberal    network so if I'm talking about a matrix    multiplication so unless and until you    are very sure about these kind of a    concept you will not be able to do lots    and lots of time a debugging where you    will be able to get an issue for sure so    I will be able to change a dimension as    well for a particular array so if I have    a array maybe having a one dimension so    I can try to change these things into a    two dimension or into a three dimension    or into a multiple dimension doesn't    matter at all now so I can try to create    a array NP dot a double RA Y and then    maybe I can try to give a list we have    already seen that how I can try to    change a dimension now so I can try to    change data type as well data type is    equal to maybe I can try to write    complex so in a very first class we have    seen that complex number is a kind of a    number where you will be able to get a    real data type plus you will be able to    get some kind of imaginary data type and    for imagine a data type notation will be    equal to J suppose I have this data type    1 plus like a 2 J so 1 is nothing but    it's a real number whereas 2 is nothing    but it's a imaginary factor and J is    nothing but it's a notation it's a    notation for a imaginary number or a    complex number altogether you can say so    it's completely fine if I wanted to like    convert all the data into a complex    number so as we can see that complex    part is equal to 0 complex we don't have    a complex part as of now so what will    happen in this case is it is going to    add a complex number by the factor of 0    over here so still data is same the only    thing which I have done over here is so    I have changed a data type in this    particular place and I will be able to    get a complex number as simple as that    this is what you will be able to get    again so in last example let's suppose    if I am going to take like a 1 list one    list with our 3 number and other list I    have which is having like a 2 number if    I am going to    and what these things you will not be    able to get a proper array it will be    able to convert into a n dimensional    array a multi-dimensional array so only    in a case of if you're all the list    element is having a same kind of a sale    if safe is different if length of the    list is different so in that case you    will end up getting this kind of a data    so most of you are going to get this    kind of a result for sure this is a    normal result I would say this is what    you can expect so it will not be able to    convert you an entire list into a array    yes that will be another but it will not    be able to convert these things into a n    dimensional array unless and until size    of the list that you are going to take    inside an array is not equal to say in    case of a multi-dimensional array then    you are going to pass a multiple list    only in that case I would say so fine    until this point so we have discussed    now let's try to understand one more    thing so I'm going to take an array so    maybe I can try to write like an NP a    double are a double rvy over here and    then I can try to take one list in this    particular case just try to focus over    here for some time so I am trying to    take like a 3 comma 4 and then I can try    to take maybe like a 5 comma 6 over here    that is completely fine so I'm trying to    take a red over here and take basically    like a list which I'm trying to convert    into an array it is completely fine I'm    able to do that but insider list so    instead of taking a list and I have    taken tuples so it's completely fine if    I am going to execute it I will be able    to convert this entire data into a    arraign this is actually array so    whenever you are going to pass a list of    the tuples or list of the list in both    the cases you will end up getting this    kind of a data without any even but it's    completely fine you will be able to get    it now one more thing I wanted to    discuss over here so in last example I    was trying to give data type is equal to    complex you can try to keep data type is    equal to integer or maybe a string you    can try to pass maybe a floating point    you can try to pass here I will be using    something different something completely    different I am going to use so data type    and    data type is equal to maybe I can try to    mention unlist over here and then I can    try to mention like add two tuples over    here so just like a two pass that we    have chicken in this particular place    and in a first tuple what I will do is    so in a first tuple I can try to say    that okay so a so I can try to say a and    a comma and again a common lesser than I    for this is the new things this is a new    notation that you will be able to get    and in the second one what I can do is I    can try to write like a B over here and    B comma and then I can try to mention    maybe lesser than equal to a to lesser    than I - I can try to mention so so far    so far so far so forth you must have    seen that I was talking about a integer    I was talking about a floor I was    talking about a STR I was talking about    a boolean and complex and a different    different kind of a primitive data type    that is completely fine there is no like    a if and but with respect to that but    here and trying to define a data type in    big defend me Here I am trying to define    data type in a completely different way    and I think this is not a approach that    we have seen so far so forth what is the    meaning of that let's try to understand    it what is the meaning of this    particular datatype notation so here as    you can see that you have taken    basically a list and inside a list so    you have a tuple so we have basically a    list of the tuple element that is    completely fine inside every tuple I    have two elements so I have like element    a I have a element B let's suppose I can    have a element a element B just for the    reference I'm trying to talk about that    now here what we have done is so as a    data type so we have mentioned a is    equal to i4 now there is no such a which    exists for sure it's just a reference    means whatever element that we have    inside a tuple    it will try to clear that as a a b c d    whatever you want to take just take it    there won't be an issue    again over here so I have taken B means    whatever data which I have available    inside a tuple so we will try to take    these things as a B so it's completely    fine we have taken a and B so it will    try to consider this as a this as B    this as a this as be fine now for a we    have defined this as a data type for B    we have defined this as a data type this    is what I am trying to perform this is    what I am trying to do over here so for    a I for is a data type and for B so    basically i2 is a data type let's try to    verify that what is a meaning of this I    for and what is the meaning of this I to    which I am going to consider so what    kind of a data type this I for and i2 is    I will try to understand that particular    part so if I am going to execute it it's    completely fine I am able to get my    array along with my data type so the    syntax wise there is no issue there is    no problem I'll try to store these    things maybe into a variable called as    end so let's try to restore these things    inside the valuable call as in and then    what I will do is I will try to access a    data in off zero so in of zero means but    so let's suppose if I am going to    execute this part let's suppose if I am    going to execute just this particular    part so I'm supposed to pass a bracket    over here so if I am going to execute    this part so if I have to access this    element this element is available at 0    of 0 position 0 1 0 1 so 0 of 0 I will    be able to access this 3 so what I will    do is I will try to access this 3 and    then I will try to check its data type    so that I will be able to understand a    meaning of iPhone just try to focus over    here of a 5 minute because you will not    be able to understand this particular    mapping if you are not going to focus    for at least 5 minutes    so here I will try to access basically 0    of 0 if I am going to execute it I am    able to get this particular 3 it's    completely fine I am able to access it    but it's complete like I'm not    interested in to just our access of the    data I am interested in to like a dinner    time so typ e t YP I can try to type    over here and you will be able to find    out that it is representing I integer    32-bit it is trying to present int L    32-bit let's suppose I will try to    access 4 so 4 is nothing but 0 of 1 so I    can try to do a type of n of I would say    like a 0 of 1 and    in this way you will be able to find out    that it's representing idea 16 now what    is a meaning of this so as we have    already discussed that it will try to    map this first element of a tuple with a    and a second element of tuple will it be    for a element means for three we have    given a tonight is equal to i4 now when    I am trying to check this data time it's    basically representing an integer 32-bit    and when I am trying to check at it a    type of B means a B element so it is    trying to give me integer 16 so inside    an numpy you will be able to find out it    we don't have only our integer we have    integer 16-bit we have integer 32-bit    and we have an integer 64-bit as well so    here you will be able to find out a    primitive data type off data time so    it's not only an integer so far so forth    even in other programming languages you    will be able to find out just a data    type but here you will be able to find    out that it is possible to create our    integer just with a 16-bit just with the    32-bit or just with the 64-bit and again    it depends upon the big endian and    little-endian notation so I think if you    are faster from the computer science    background so you will be able to    understand this big-endian or    little-endian notation or you might have    heard about this particular word called    as big-endian or little-endian notation    so based on that since this data type is    been defined so based on the system so    maybe I can try to take digital type but    again it's not a major concern I would    say so just for the information so I am    just trying to like give you this kind    of example so that you will be able to    understand that there is not only    integer data type which is available    there is a 16-bit there is a pretty two    bit and there is a 64-bit which is    available now let's suppose if I am    going to change this things to eight now    what will happen in this case you will    be able to find out that not 64-bit    basically so i8 is going to represent    this is just a notation so i8 is    representing 64-bit let's suppose if I    am going to make these things as a    sixteen so what will happen in that case    there is an error so it will not be able    to understand    so who is available for is available and    eight is available so these are the 10    today which is available to simply means    that I'm talking about a 16-bit for    simply means that I am talking about    32-bit and it simply means that I am    talking about a 64-bit so this is how    you will be able to convert or you will    be able to get a different different    kind of integer data type itself with    respect to a bit or a bit respect to a    big-endian or little-endian notation now    so in my life I have never used this    particular notation while doing a data    processing but if you are going to    develop some kind of algorithm or maybe    if you are going to write a code which    just depends upon the 16-bit computation    or maybe a 64-bit computation or maybe a    34 bit computation at that point of a    time this kind of a concept may be handy    but as far as this data processing is    concerned or model building is concerned    into a image with respect to image or    maybe like textual data or maybe with    respect to a tabular data data frame so    you are not going to encounter these    things are frequently so it's completely    fine so just for the information so I    have shown you these particular things    now let's suppose let's suppose I wanted    to build a matrix data type so matrix is    basically a data type which is available    inside a number package I can try to    create it it's very easy so what I can    do is I can try to call n P dot ma T so    you will be able to find out that Matt    is something which is available inside    of numpy package what I can do is I can    try to do the selection operation and    then I can try to pass maybe a list over    here let's see what happens so if I am    going to pass a very simple list a    similar kind of full list which I have    passed inside my array now you will be    able to find out that my data type is    not array my data type is basically a    matrix S so matrix is a subset or    subclass of a array so Allah is a super    class inside numpy and matrix is a    subclass of that particular a child    class of a array if I am going to check    a type of this so for sure it is going    to    me our metrics data type as expected so    numpy dot matrixes so it's a did a type    of the sack type like matrixes you will    be able to get it so this is completely    fine now what I will try to do is so I    will try to perform some kind of    operation so there is something called    as a numpy dot as any array as any    airing now so what is the meaning of    this as any airing and what it does    basically so as we have already seen in    our previous example that if I am going    type numpy dot a double RA Y dy and if    I'm going too fast maybe list over here    it will give me array if I am going to    call so let's suppose I have creditor    matrixes over here and if I am going to    store this matrixes em inside a variable    M so this is my matrix data type as of    now now if I am going to pass this M and    inside NP dot array a double ROI and    then if I'm going to pass em over here    so if I am going to pass a list element    it is going to convert into array if I    am going to pass a matrix element it is    going to convert an element into array    so in both the cases in case of our list    or in case of a matrixes in both the    cases it is able to convert my data in a    form of array that is come really fine    but what does any array bin do so let's    try to understand this thing that's the    reason so I have given you these two    examples so here what this will try to    do is so let's suppose if I am going to    pass let's suppose if I am going to pass    a list over here so list Y is 5 comma 6    comma 7 comma 7 th so it is able to    convert into an array that is completely    fine but what if if I am going to pass    my matrix inside this one MP dot or like    as any array so as any arraign and what    is my matrix element m so what if I am    going to pass my matrix s over here so    you will be able to find out that no    this time it is not trying to convert    this time it is not trying to convert    into an array last time in this case    in this case I was trying to pass a list    convert it into array I was trying to    pass a metric says convert it into array    but this time when I am trying to pass a    list yes it is able to convert these    things into array but when I am trying    to pass a metric says in as any array it    is not trying to convert it so what is    the definition of this as any hurry    diffusion of as any erases that if if my    data set is available in some form if my    data set is available in some form of    the array I will not try to convert it    if my data set is available if - it will    not be available in some form of numpy    array so then only I will try to do a    conversion so as we all know that list    is not an element which is which is like    array this is not an array like an    element this is something which exists    inside a Python core so that's the    reason so it is trying to convert into    array but like I told you    matrix is nothing but it's a subclass of    array itself so matrix is re actually    matrix is a type of the array or matrix    is an instance of any instance miss    object of array I would say so matrix is    already a instance of array so in that    case it will not try to do a conversion    that this is what as any array is trying    to do for sure if you have to convert    something into array you can try to call    numpy array or number not as array here    are the two function which is available    but II if I don't want to convert some    element which is already in some form of    arranged so in that case I can try to    use as any array so only it will try to    do a conversion only if my data set is    not available in any form of array a    simple logic a simple concept over here    now again I don't try to remember any of    this function which I am trying to talk    about forget about everything don't    remember anything just try to practice    it and with practice you will be able to    learn many more things I would say now    next thing which I am going I'm going to    talk about is a deep copy and a solid    copy what is the meaning of a deep copy    and what is the meaning of a hollow copy    now this deep copy and swallow copy    concept is available in almost every    programming    languages so let's try to understand it    that what is what I'm trying to prove    over here and how I'm trying to perform    deep copy operation and a solid copy a    patient so let's suppose what I will do    is I will try to create a variable    called as a is nothing but so numpy a    double are a wide array and then inside    that so I can try to pass maybe a 4    comma 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma 8 it's    completely fine and then what I will do    is I can try to create a variable V and    B is equal to 8 it's completely fine now    so then what I will do is I will try to    access B you will be able to find out    that I have created a variable a and    inside a variable a I have these    elements and trying to perform a    reassignment operation means B is equal    to a means whatever element we have    inside a a so we will be having a same    element what happens inside a memory so    whenever I am going to create like a    variable a so it is going to take one    place and then here it is trying to    refer this like it is going to refer to    this variable and then inside that it is    going to call 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7    comma 8 as simple as that now whenever I    am trying to perform this assignment    operation so in that case this B will    always refer to the same location so my    a and B by doing this operation is    trying to refer to the same location so    whenever I am trying to call this B it's    not really fine I'm able to get a same    element whatever element I had inside a    I am able to get a same kind of an    element over here now what is the    meaning of this deep copy and swallow    copy let's try to understand let's    suppose if I am trying to access V of 0    V of 0 so we observe is nothing but the    zeroth element it's completely fine now    if I try to modify an element which is    available at 0th position so maybe    instead of using for I wanted to use    this number on instead of using up for    on a geolocation so this assignment    operation is completely fine I am able    to assign a new element on a 0th indexes    that is completely fine now if I would    and if I print this B yes this is a and    changes which I have done this is the    data manipulation which I have done if    I'm going to call a so with respect to a    I have not done a changes but as B and a    both is referring to a same location    because I have done B is equal to a    operation so in this case it will try to    change a as well so it will change B as    well as it will try to change a a so    whenever whatever modification you will    do in a it will be reflected in B and    whenever you would like to do some kind    of a changes into B it will be reflected    into a because both is trying to point    to the same location what if if I don't    want to do it what if if I am looking    for some kind of an element there    initially element will be same but    whenever I am trying to make a changes    into one element it should not make a    change into other element in this case    both is referred to the same location so    if I am going to change in one valuable    it is going to reflect a same changes    into other variable because location is    same like it is trying to point to the    same location now what I will do is I    will try to create another variable on a    C and inside a see I can try to call    numpy I would say that Co py copy and    here I will try to pass a it's    completely fine now what will happen in    this particular case so here when I am    going to create a variable C so it's    completely fine it will try to create a    reference variable C now what is a value    which I am trying to assign so I am    trying to assign a value which is    available inside now a as of now this is    the value which is available inside or    in after modification for sure so here    in P dot copy so what this copy command    will do so it will not try to point out    to the same location it will try to    reserve a new location for you it will    try to point means this variable is    going to point to this new location and    then it will try to copy this data from    here to here so here I will be having a    data now now what will happen so now    suppose if I am going to make some    changes so C is equal to this data and a    is equal to this day    means in C and in a in both the location    I have a similar kind of a data in both    the location I have exactly same data    set which is available so okay so here    you will be able to find out that in C    and in a I have exactly same data    because I have done copy basically so    copy or data from A to C this is what I    have done now if I'll try to modify    something in C suppose if I am trying to    modify something in C so C of 0 C of 0    is 535 maybe I can try to assign some    different like a number over here and    then if I am going to print C so it has    changed C for sure so previously it was    535 now itself 343 simple so it has made    the changes there is no even but with    respect to back if I'll try to print a    now it has not done a changes with    respect to a or vice versa if I am going    to make some changes into a you will be    so a of 0 maybe this kind of a number    and if I am going to print a this is    something that it has done but if I'll    try to print C it is not going to    reflect a same changes into C so here Y    it is not differently changes because    location where my C is trying to point    and the location where my a is trying to    point is completely different    so when I have done copy operation numpy    not copy so I have copied this entire    data from this location this location so    whatever I am going to perform over here    will be independent of the operation    which I am going to perform in this    particular place so this is what happens    so basically the approach which I have    used in this one the approach which I    have used over here to assign a value so    this particular approach is called as a    deep copy and this particular approach    is called as a swallow copy this is    something and this is how you are    supposed to understand it so this is    called as a swallow copy and this is    called as a deep copy in case of a deep    copy if you are going to make a    in one valuable it will not reflect a    change into other variable but in case    of a solo copy so well if you are going    to change one variable it will try to    reflect a same kind of a changes into    other variables as well so this is what    you are you should know I would say so    it's completely fine now moving ahead    and let's try to understand that how and    what in all different different kind of    a function which is available insider    number so let's let's try to understand    it so I can try to call basically a    function called as numpy dot from    function so from function I can try to    call now so what this from function does    let's try to understand it so I can try    to call like I can try to create lambda    over here so lambda is going to take    maybe x and y and then it is going to    perform I would say like X is equal    equal to Y operation and then I can try    to be maybe a dimension so 3 comma maybe    a 4 I can try to give if I am going to    execute it this is what I will be able    to get so in numpy every time whenever    you are going to get some kind of an    output every time you will be able to    get some kind of array or some kind of a    matrixes whatever function you are going    to use that is a speciality of a numpy    that you will be able to find out now so    here what I have done so here I am    trying to use numpy dot from function    now what is trying to do so from a    function it will try to generate some    kind of any so far so forth I have been    using like a NP dot array or maybe NV    dot as array or NP dot as any array or    NP dot map so these are the function    that I have been using so far so forth    it's completely fine now if I am going    to use this strong function kind of a    thing so in that case it will try to    generate this particular array based on    the function which I have given over    here    now in this particular place you can try    to write your external function you can    try to call your channel function or you    can try to write your lambda function as    we have already discussed about the    lambda function in our previous classes    so when I was talking about a map I was    talking about a reviews or I was talking    about like many things in other places    so I talked about or I have discussed    about a lambda function for sure so it's    completely fine not an issue    so here what this lambda function is    trying to do so here you will be able to    find out that this lambda function is    trying to take two argument and it is    trying to perform X is equal equal to Y    I have given dimension is equal to 3    cross 4 so when I'm trying to give a 3    cross 4 it means I am trying to create    an array of 3 row I would say and 4    column this is what I am trying to do so    this is a dimension which I have given 3    cross 4 0 4 column I have given now I am    trying to write like XY so you will try    to take two valuable - argument XY is    equal to X is equal to Y and then based    on this function and in this array so it    will try to give you a final matrix or    final array let's try to understand this    part so here what it will do is it will    try to match a column and a row and    column value so 0 is equal equal to 0    here we are trying to do X is equal to Y    so X is nothing but this one Y is    nothing but this one so 0 is equal equal    to 0 yes it's true    0 is equal to 1 false 0 is equal to 1 to    2 false 0 is equal to 1 2 3 Falls 1 is    equal to 0 false 1 is equal to 1 to 1 is    equal to 2 false false false false true    false this is the same output you will    be able to find out over here so it is    trying to give you on it is trying to    generate a data based on this function    so function that you have written on top    of some kind of a dimension because like    I told you so numpy dot array always try    to give you some kind of array except    array it is not going to give you any    other things so fine guys this is what    like I am able to get in this particular    please so I'm able to get basically our    data out of this particular function so    it's completely fine now what I will do    is I will try to write maybe some other    kind of a function as well so I can try    to copy the same thing and I can try to    write maybe X plus y now let's see what    happens in case of X plus y so here if    I'm going to write express fire logic is    not going to change at all so what it    will do is so it is going to take 0 1 2    because it's the 3 cross 4 so 0 and 0 1    2 3 so 4 column now I have written X    plus y X plus y if I've written so 0    plus 0 0 0 plus 1 1 0 plus 2 2 and 3 1    plus 0 1 1 plus 1 2 1 plus 2 is equal to    3 1 plus 3 is equal to 4 2 plus 0 2 2    plus 1 3 2 plus 2 4 2 + 3 5 it's an    exact same data you will be able to get    even over here this is how it is going    to give you a data base on the row and    column condition that you have written    so here I have written like a plus    operation and last time I have written    basically a boolean operation so true    and false kind of operations I have    written in a last cases so it's    completely fine guys again this is like    how I will be able to perform our data    manipulations over here not an issue now    what I can do is I can write maybe like    any kind of other things over here like    a minus plus division subtraction maybe    X minus y into let's suppose 6 I can    write whatever I want so there won't be    any issue and based on that I will end    up generate enough array so this is just    a function by which you will be able to    generate a array where on your logic the    logic that you are going to write now    the next thing which I am going to    perform or the next thing which I am    going to do so what I can try to do is    suppose if I have a string so I have    used n P dot from function now NP dot    from string I can try to use and then I    can try to pass maybe a string over here    so maybe I can try to pass like one    space three space a fight something like    that if I am going to pass this is    basically    string I've enclosed my data within a    string you will be able to find out and    then what I can do is separate otherwise    I can try to write like separator is    equal to a space if I am going to    execute it so it will try to take this    string you'll try to take this string    and then it will try to separate my data    based on the space because by default    separator will be equal to space so even    if I'm not going to mention these things    I think it will work fine now here so I    have used basically string my separate    is a comma so I am supposed to mention    separator is equal to comma if I'm not    going to mention it will not be able to    separate it and as you can see so yes    after separation so I am able to get a    data maybe I can try to pass some kind    of SUV edge and comma K um in are    something like that and in this case    what you will be able to get as nothing    it's a blank data that you will be able    to get let's try to understand that    whether I will be able to change at a    time or not so data dty PE is equal to    STR so if I am going to mention    something like that so here you will be    able to find out that it is not able to    understand this particular thing it is    trying to give me an issue that 0 valued    item size so whatever item that you are    trying to mention over here no it's not    able to like understand this item if I'm    going to give 6 comma 7 again it is not    able to understand suppose if I am going    to give integer now it is able to    understand basically so datatype eyes    and trying to pass a integer and then    I'm trying to pass a separator data wise    I am trying to pass a string so if you    try to read this string it will try to    separate it and finally it is going to    give you integer AHA array over here so    likewise you can try to perform like any    kind of a permutation combination and    you will be able to get a similar kind    of data now the next thing which I am    going to perform over here is so let's    suppose if I am going to create array a    basic array I will try to create so    or that I will try to create a nested    list maybe so 3 comma 4 comma 5 and then    maybe I can try to use like 6 comma 7    comma 8 comma 8 and timing should be    same otherwise it is going to give you    an object off a list this comma 7 comma    9 and I can try to close it now in P dot    a double rdy array a so I'm trying to    convert this data the data that I had    over here into this particular form into    a form of array so I am able to convert    my list into an array not an issue so I    will try to store these things inside a    variable called as n should be envied so    yeah so I'm trying to convert these    things into a array now what I will do    is I will try to show you our basic    operations over here so if I am wanted    to know that what is a dimension of this    particular array so as we can observe    that dimension of this particular array    is nothing but it's a two dimension but    I still I wanted to print it so n dot I    can try to type nd I M so I will be able    to get that dimension of this array is    equal to two now so at the time of    creation of a arrays so I have like    ending parameter now if I am going to    overwrite this parameter and if I am    going to mention dimension is equal to    ten what happens in this case so for    sure it is going to attach a 10 square    bracket in front of my data so as you    can see and then if I'm going to check    it's a ten dimension but by default so    by default the dimension of this array    is equal to I would say two and this    information is very much important this    is a small information it's completely    fine but when we try to do a    mathematical computation a mathematical    calculation in between a metric says so    you are going to get an issue because if    dimension of the data is not same so you    are going to face many problems many    kind of problem and then you will have    to go for the reshaping of the data but    again in what kind of re shape are like    what kind of reshape you will be able to    do you will be    to get all the information by following    this approach itself so it's completely    fine I am able to get a dimension there    is something called as a size so n dot    size if I am going to compute size means    what size means a total number of an    element inside this particular array or    a matrixes    ever is going to work on array same    thing we'll walk into a matrixes as well    so sighs sighs always talk about a    number of the element now I can try to    tie maybe a shape safe is nothing but a    row into columns as you can see I have a    three rows and three columns inside my    data so in by n or n cross M so whatever    is a size of your matrix is number of    rows and number of columns that you have    inside a matrixes so shape is going to    give you that one so it is going to tell    me that okay fine so like a shape of    this particular array is nothing but    itself 3 cross 3 and slice always give    you like a number of element my men    shall always try to give you that what    is a dimension whether my array is a one    T or maybe a 2 D or maybe a zero    dimension so maybe I can try to create    this array so M is equal to NP dot a    double re why array and then inside that    maybe I can try to pass 5 comma 6 comma    7 over here and m dot ending if I am    going to check it's a one dimensional    array I would say so suppose if I am    going to remove these things I'm going    to put just a bracket it's a one    dimensional array so by default if you    are your array is even blank so in that    case it will be a one dimensional array    that you will be able to get so 1 D 2 D    3 d 4 D this kind of array that you will    be able to get now so there is another    thing which you should know so suppose    if I wanted to know that what is our    data type of an array because data type    of the entire array will be same like we    have already seen that even if a single    data which is available inside your    array is in a float it will try to    convert even try to upcast    every data set which is available inside    the array so D type and you will be able    to find out that the entire data which I    have inside my array is having 32 now if    I wanted to override    I can try to override it maybe I can try    to keep my all the element as a 16-bit    or maybe as a 64-bit or maybe as a    64-bit or maybe as a 16-bit so it's    completely fine we talked about like an    eye - we talked about eye for we talked    about I ate so that is a way if you are    going to define data type is equal to I    to or I ate or maybe I four so in that    way you will end up converting your data    into a 16-bit 32-bit or 64-bit but by    default yes this is what you will be    able to receive so fine guys these are    the full function that you should    remember so that will help you out to    check your array and accordingly you can    try to go for the modification next    thing which I will be talking about is    called as a arrange function so I think    we talked about arrange function so RNG    this is a function that we have    discussed in a very beginning and if I'm    going to pass five so we all know that    it is going to generate a data in    between zero to five excluding five    excluding upper boundary now let's    suppose if I am going to give five dot    means five as a floating point number so    in this case it is going to give me an    issue it is telling me that no I can't    accept putting one number    I only take integer so even as an    initial point even as a final point if I    am going to give or even as a step size    if I am going to give maybe like a    floating point it is going to give me a    similar kind of issue so range function    is a function which always accepts a    integer it is not going to accept    anything else except integer at any    point of time this is how I would say    entire range function is been designed    so it's completely fine guys so you will    be able to use in only a integer in this    particular case you will not be able to    use anything else except a integer now    now what I should do so now if I have to    like take maybe like a floating point    and based on that if I have to generate    a data so in that case I will not look    for the range function what I can do    I can try to call numpy dot a range    function so erage is something which is    available inside a number inside that I    can try to pass maybe 0.5 it's    completely fine I can try to like get a    data I can try to like keep upper    boundary as a nine point eight seven    let's suppose this is the upper boundary    it is not going to complain me it's    completely fine maybe I can try to eat    initial point as 12.5 and 2.5 as an    initial point and then this is a final    point and the size of the steps are    nothing but 0.5 so you know point 5 if I    am going to give not an issue it's    completely fine so it will be able to    accept a floating-point number as an    initial point as a final point and as a    step size and it will be able to give    you a data set so this is something that    you will be able to experience with    respect to our image function so arrange    function I would say always works with    the integer as well as it is going to    work with the floating point number but    if I'll talk about just arrange    functions where each function is only    going to work with respect to all    integer it is never going to work with    the floating point number so I think we    are good with like a these operations    that we have done and again once you    will be able to get a data with the help    of our image function so what ever data    slicing operations are indexing    operations that we have discussed so    same data slicing operation similar kind    of a data indexing operations you will    be able to achieve even with respect to    this image function exactly the same    thing if you have to do some kind of a    reverse maybe column 4-1 or something    like that you will be able to do and you    will be able to reverse your data you    will be able to like a slice your data    set so fine guys this is what I like I    have to discuss with you now the next    function that I can talk about is called    as a numpy dot and again    that it is always going to give you how    array now if I have to convert this    array into a list I can do that as well    so maybe I can try to store these things    inside N and then I can try to call a    list function inside that I can try to    pass n as an array I will be able to get    a list this is the list but it is going    to return you up okay so inside an    umpire package whatever you are going to    get you will be able to get each and    everything just as an array nothing else    you will be able to get so it's    completely fine    you    hey guys let's start discussion this    thing so fine I was talking about the NH    function now what I can do is I can talk    about Harnam Phi dot line space function    little I any blank space function okay    now what will happen in this case    so line is faces are another function    which you can use to generate a theta so    let's try to understand that how you    will be able to generate my data with a    line space function so you can try to    give me a initial point you can try to    give maybe a final point and then in    this case this is not same as a range    function on a range function range and    ingredients both are same the only    difference is a range is a part of a    Python whole area is a part of her numpy    and the second difference is a range can    only consider integer    whereas a range consider floating point    as well as integer now here there is a    function called as line space now what    this line space is going to do so    suppose if I have given initial point is    equal to 3 final point is equal to 7 and    then I have even 20 so what it will try    to do this so it will try to generate a    20 number of the rain last time in case    of a range function it was basically a    step size means here in this particular    case it was a step size means it will    start from here to point 5 plus step    size 3 plus the step size 3.5 and so on    but here this is not a step size this is    a basically a number of the element that    you are looking for in between these    scale so in between 3 to 7 it will try    to find out 20 number I can say that in    between any number in between even 0 to    1 you can generate a billion number you    can generate a infinite numbers over    here that is possible and it's possible    I will say so it is trying to generate a    number you will be able to find out that    starting from 3 ending till 7 and the    total number which it has generated is    equal to 20 if I wanted to generate    maybe a 200 number I can    generate a 200 number in between three    to seven itself as you can see so if I    have to generate our numbers in between    certain scale in that is I can try to    use a line space and it is going to    generate that mean number for me it's a    very very basic concept and again I like    up if I'm going to eat maybe like a    floating point number over here it is    going to work maybe if I'm going to be    maybe two point nine zero it is going to    work with someone morning    let's company define there is no meaning    of giving a step size equal to this one    what must I do I have passed it so this    is what you will be able to find out    guys so in case of a line space you can    try to generate any number in between    any of the number that you are going to    give and yes for sure it is going to    work for you now if you will look into    the parameter of this line space so    parameterize it takes like a starting    point end point and number of the    element that you are looking for suppose    if I am not giving the Samba so even in    this case it will generate some number    that number is equal to 50 so you are    not going to give a third argument so in    that case it will try to give you a    fifty number as per the mention argument    now so you can try to mention end point    is equal to false let's suppose if I am    going to mention end point is equal to    my default it will be true so false if I    am going to mention now what will happen    end point wise I have mentioned seven    point nine let's suppose so suppose if I    am NOT going to give end point or let's    suppose end point is equal to true so in    this case it will try to include a final    point as well means upper boundary as    well so here you will be able to find    out that seven point nine in my upper    boundary yes it is including it but if I    am going to make this things as a false    you will be able to find out that no it    is not going to include my final    boundary point just like a range and    arrange function so this is what a kind    of things that you will be able to get    out of this one so it's completely fine    guys so end point    now a red step so rate a step is equal    to by default it's equal to false now if    I'm going to make these things as a true    what is the meaning of that    so been able you are trying to when I    work basically like up here if I'm going    to write like a fight it means that I am    trying to generate five element type    element so this five element in between    these two this range this is the meaning    of this so I'm trying to generate    basically five element 1 2 3 4 5 5 11 I    am trying to generate in between these    two this skill so starting from a    three-team are seven point nine the    scale and try to generate now penny walk    it will try to generate five data so it    will equally divide this entire insert    into find space equally it will divide    now by default it is not going to give    you that after because if I'm trying to    generate maybe a data set on let's    suppose like different manner generate a    file data in between 1 to 10 so 5 date I    have managed in there so first data    could be one then two then four and then    six and then eight this is something    which I can write so if I'm trying to    generate like a fine red excluding the    upper bound so this is how we will be    able to do it    so everywhere it is trying to take some    kind of a constant is registered so if    you are going to make this register is    equal to true so it will try to tell you    that okay what is the difference between    this and this this and this    so difference between this and this is    the system different this and it says    this step so this is what it is going to    do by default it will be equal to false    now there is another argument that you    will be able to get over here so another    argument so no we have discussed on the    end part we have discussed in our type    so data type eyes you try to mention    anything suppose by default it's given    as an axis is equal to zero access you    go means no suppose if I am going to    mention axis one over here so here you    will be able to find out that based on    the let's suppose if I have given this    one    it takes access 0 by default and there    is no other parameter which is given    access 0 so if I have a    multi-dimensional array so in that case    yes it is going to give me access to    your access to but I just have a linear    are they don't that is there is no    meaning of getting access model because    I do not have any kind of a column I    just have a row over here now the next    thing that we are going to talk about is    so how we can create a different    different kind of arrays and how I will    be able to perform a reset population    because release of operation is very    much important the same operation is    always important and as a data scientist    you are going to use this greasy of    operation and degeneration or random    rate regeneration operation almost on a    daily basis so that belief I am going to    give NP dot j ER po n P dot zeros so    zeroes if I am going to give and then    what I can try to do this so I can try    to give maybe five over here so it is    going to generate a data with all the    day now with zeros I would say so again    I can try to give maybe our dimension    over here so maybe I can try to write    over here so five cross six in this case    it is going to generate five row six    column all the element it is going to    fill by this number of data let's    suppose if I am going to give maybe a to    cross by cross six it's a 3d data so    here you will be able to find out that I    have created a 3d data over here so - so    we have a basically like a to array to    array we have off side is 5 plus 6 so    this is having a factor of six size and    this is having up five to six size this    is how you are supposed to understand or    in a real time so you can try to    understand in this way so we have a data    1 data and we have another data just    behind off this data so if I'll talk    about the axis so axis wise suppose we    have our x axis we have our y axis and    we have a jet axis so suppose you factor    data array over here so this array is    nothing but that's a 2d array I have a    x-axis and a y-axis means I have a    column but if I am going to place    something over here just right    visualize it just like our pages which    is available inside your books so if you    will try to start folding your pages so    one by one one by one one by one so one    after another in pattern you will be    able to get other pages in a similar way    so if you will try to visualize these    things this is how you can visualize we    have one array and behind that we have    another array in depth so height width    and length you can consider or maybe x    axis y axis or z axis you can try to    consider so we have one array behind    another array so how many array we have    we have actually touring so this is one    array I would say this is one of the    array that I have at the second array    that we have is nothing but this one    second Harrod that we have is nothing    but this one just behind this so I have    window tell I have one array is this one    and another array is this one not random    so to what is a size of one array so    size of one array is five plus six so    size of the array which is available    behind this array is also five cross six    these things are important when you will    try to talk about the image processing    this things is very much important I    would say whenever we talk about regime    is processing when you will try to    understand a convolution neural network    so you will be able to find out that it    try to follow the same approach so this    is how you can understand a    multi-dimensional array over here I can    try to create maybe a four dimensional    array as well so here maybe I can try to    mention like two two over here and this    is nothing but a four dimensional array    it's completely fine it's a four    dimensional but visualization wise you    will not be able to visualize it for    sure there is no 4d which is available    in which we can visualize as of now just    till 3d I will be able to visualize it    even over here or even inside your like    visualization tool by using a macro tape    see ball or maybe a cufflinks this is    how I will be able to visualize it so    it's completely fine guys I am able to    create all the array with a zeros there    is something called as a NP dot once I    would say and it's same as I would say    like zeros instead of giving a zero it    tried to give you just up so we try to    give you    would say it tried to give you one so    like a three row and four column it is    trying to give it to you so we have like    a three row and we have a four column    over here this is the kind of array    which is created I can try to mention    true cross the cross for so it's    completely fine so two array we have to    already have over here of size three    cross food this is how you are supposed    to understand so one I really have to    another day so in a jet coordinate in a    jet axis I have another array in this    particular place so I can try to    generate like a array which ones array    with zeros there is no such array which    is possible with twos so there is no two    which is available I can maybe try to    like a created maybe I can try to    perform this operation so twos and four    threes I can create it just by    performing this kind of the broadcasting    operation now the another thing that I    will be talking about is so if I am    going to call NV dot dot TM PTY empty so    if I am going to pass maybe four cross    five over here I will be able to get    some random number in case of empty now    if I am going to print this mg off maybe    a zero of a zero I just wanted to show    you like what is the exact element which    is available well over here you will be    able to get three now if I am going to    execute yeah completely fine so in your    case when you will try to execute a same    thing so sometime you will end up    getting some time you will end up    getting maybe are three four five six on    some time you will be end up getting a    very small number I would say so or    sometimes you will be able to get maybe    zeros here you will be able to find out    that I am able to get a very small    number in to the power minus 311 which    is a very very small number which I am    able to get so empty is nothing but it    just try to give you or it just try to    create some kind of a random element and    it will try to give almost element close    to zero most of the time most of the    time I'm not saying that all the time    but most of the time if we try to give    you a helmet close to zero in some of    your system you will end up getting zero    as well that is called as a empty array    I would say empty means a value    just close to a zero now the next thing    which I will be talking about is called    as a MP dot e ye I do so I is nothing    but itself identity matrix I think in a    childhood we talked about it man and    standard so we generally talk about    matrixes in which we will be having a 1    1 1 in a diagonal element as an idol    elements so if I have to like I want you    to get like a 1 1 1 and if I'm trying to    do a matrix multiplication it should    give me only one that kind of a matrix    is called as a identity matrix and if    you are going to create my data matrix    identities will always be a square    matrix S five matrix means number of row    and number of columns should always be    same that is called as a square matrix    so a greedy matrix will be like a for    sure it will be a spy matrixes and    whenever you are trying to perform a    matrix multiplication or matrix    computation so it is going to give you    one so it is possible to create IMD    matrix of any dimension so I can try to    give four I just have to give like a one    element one input over here because row    and column will be same because I dream    it this will be a square matrixes so you    will be able to find out that all the    diagonal elements are one now if you    will try to perform a calculation on a    determinant of this particular matrixes    you will be able to get one as a final    outcome it's completely fine    so this is where or this is how you will    be able to create I would say like    identity matrix s again these things are    very much important when it comes to our    data or matrix multiplication because    image processing or similar processing    or like the training a model is nothing    but it's a matrix multiplication if you    are going to use like a neural network    it's nothing but it's just a matrix    multiplication in itself with    derivatives so it's completely fine this    is what you will be able to get now the    another one another thing that I can    talk about is called as a log phase so    let's try to talk about that what is a    meaning of a longest phase what is a    meaning of a line space and how this    thing's is actually going to    so fine guys I think I talked about    Linus face now this time so let's try to    understand that how I will be able to    get a logarithmic of the data set again    so it's nothing new or nothing fancy I    would say so it's almost same as a line    space that we have discussed so I can    try to call n P dot log space so alone g    space now what I can do is I can try to    maybe give up the range in between 5.6    27.8 and maybe i wanted to generate 6    element so what will happen is it is    trying to generate our 6 element and it    is not going to give you an element it    is going to give you basically a    logarithmic of all the element which it    had generated so far so forth so this is    what this particular operation is going    to give you eyes so it's completely fine    a lot of space is almost close to a line    space the only thing is line space just    give me element directly whereas long    space is going to give you a logarithmic    again you have a control so if you    wanted to change maybe a like a base of    the log you will be able to change it by    default base will be equal to 10 let's    suppose I wanted to perform on the    calculation with respect to base is    equal to 2 I'm assuming that all of you    are aware about a base so on base 2 this    is the logarithmic of each a my data it    is going to generate it's completely    fine now what I can do is so there is a    function I would say there is a function    call as a range function so let's try to    understand that what is a meaning of a    erage function and like yeah in each    function we already discuss so let's try    to understand that how we can try to    generate a random number so I can try to    call maybe like numpy again this    function these are the few of the    function which we are going to use on a    daily basis so I can try to call ra n DF    d om random and then after doing this    random so maybe I can try to call rent    so if I'm going to call numpy dot random    dot ran and then even    to pass a dimension so it is going to    create an array it is going to create an    array of size 4 cross 5 for Row 5 column    and it is going to give you a random    data it is going to give you our and    Amina so every time whenever I am going    to secure it it is going to give me a    random data there is a procedure there    is a way by which I will be able to get    a same data and you will be able to get    a same data every time even if I am    going to call a random there is    something called as a c-corporation so I    will talk about that then we talk about    that operation but yeah when time will    go so here I am trying to generate    basically a data of for cross file let's    suppose photos 5 minutes I have 20 data    let's suppose if I wanted to store this    data inside a variable M it's completely    fine I can store it and then I am trying    to generate M over here now let's    suppose if I wanted to resale or I    wanted to change our dimension of this    data so from 2d to 3d or maybe 2 1 D if    I wanted to generate or maybe I wanted    to reshape this data into some other    same so how I will be able to do it I    have in total 20 element so I can try to    call n dot resale over here and then    resell vise what I can do is I have n    total 20 element 4 plus 5 is equal to 20    so I have to give over here a dimension    which will be like a multiplicate so if    I am going to multiply these two    arguments it should always give me a 20    otherwise it is going to give you an    issue so maybe I can try to convert my    data into 10 plus 2 it's completely fine    so 10 row 2 column it's the same data    it's exact same data I am just trying to    perform what reshaping operation maybe I    can try I to perform into our twenty    cross 120 cross one so it's completely    fine I'm able to get that number miss    you now that's suppose if I wanted to    convert this data into five crores for    five gospel it's completely fine it is    able to convert this data so previous    one was photos five no itself five cross    four so you will be able to reshape your    dataset in any dimension to any    dimension there won't be any restriction    and there    any difficulties you will be able to    find out and the shaping of the data is    very much important again these are like    a few the function that you are going to    use very frequently as a data scientist    now so m dot reshape and I guess I am    able to like perform this reshaping    operation five row and then four columns    in which I am able to reshape my data    let's suppose I wanted to be say potata    and I have given the chain over here so    maybe I can try to give any kind of a    number in this particular place it is    trying to take ten costume I can give    any number over here doesn't matter at    all so in general you will be able to    find out that people used to give minus    one now it's not like minus one you    should use all the time you can use any    negative number you can try this out you    can use any negative number it's    completely fine now what this negative    number does so if you have already    defined one dimension if you want your    system to understand other dimension it    will be able to understand it looking    the rectifying so one is ten which has    been given and total number of breda is    equal to 20 so 10 cross 20 is a so 10    plus 2 is equal to 20 so it will title    like a understand minus 1 is equal to 20    so any negative number you can try to    eat over here it will try to behave into    a similar way it's not going to change    you can try to write a minus like some    data even over here at one dimension at    least you should provide see it has    converted my entire data set into two    cross ten so as you can see so I have    like that two data set and inhibited as    it I have a ten element basically so    this is how it will be able to perform    our transformations of the data into any    shape to any safe now let's suppose if I    am going to give maybe a 10 cross 3 it    is going to give you issue saying that    no I am NOT able to understand this for    you know say that you have given I just    have a 20 element so whatever dimension    that you are going to give it to me that    should be a verification of like it    should be it should always give you a 20    number if you are going to multiply like    a row and a column so this is what you    will be    to get over here guys in case of a    reshape operation now so I was talking    about our NP dot random dot align    function so what I will do is I will try    to call some other function over here so    let's suppose if I'm trying to call    around m and then if I am going to    qualify across six even in this case you    will be able to get a data there is a    very small differences you will be able    to find out between random and uh random    so if I'll talk about a rank function    over here so you will be able to find    out that it is going to give me always a    uniform distribution there is something    called a normal distribution there is    something called as a standard normal    distribution so in our statistics class    I'll talk about like basically those    things I think I will start a community    edition of the statuses classes as well    it starts in from a building which has    been required for the data scientist so    in that one I will be talking about our    bell-shaped curve I am talking about a    normal distribution I will talk about a    standard normal distribution I will be    talking about like how we try to    calculate like a y-axis by using a    normal distribution formula 1 by root of    2 pi Rho e to the power minus 1 by 2    into X minus mu by Rho of square so how    I will be able to I will generally I    used to derive these things and then I    used to talk about like what is the    significance of normally distributed    data what is the significance of a    standard normal distribution how I will    be able to convert normal distribution    into a standard normal distribution many    things we used to talk about what is the    meaning of like when we say into a    standard normal distribution mu is equal    to 0 the standard deviation is equal to    1 so everything I will be talking about    not here but into a statistics class    here you should understand that rand    function always try to give you a    uniform distribution means if you will    try to find out a mu of the data mean of    the data it will not be equal to 0 all    the time but at the same point of time    if you will try to find out mu of this    data that i've generated so you will be    able to find out so mu will be closed -    closed - I would say 0 means average    close to a Geo for this pertinent data    if you will start increasing a data size    it will start tending towards a zero in    terms of a mean or in terms of a mu so    fine so this always had to generate a    standard normal distribution now if you    will look into the definition standard    normal distribution did not in fact    generate whereas ran in function so rent    in generates a standard normal    distribution data Rand N and only rand    function if I'll talk about rand    function at from strata generate a    uniform distribution so fine guys again    apart from that so I have like a numpy    dot Rand int int I can try to give like    you gamma eight I can try to give and    then what I can do is I can try to write    like a dimension I've lost six over here    now in number I dot random dot okay    so here you will be able to find out    that there is a function called as R and    again in case of a Rand fortune in case    of around n functions always try to    generate what it all hydrogenate a    floating-point number    suppose if I wanted to generate only a    integer in between some certain ranges I    would say so yes I will be able to do    that so in between three to eight it had    generated thirty element so again there    will be a repetition because it's just    your integer in between three to eight    but it will try to give you an integer    based on the dimension that you have    given over here so this is what guys you    will be able to find out insider randant    I think we talked about re safe    operation so reshape is a basic    operation that you should know at any    point of time again in terms of for    indexing and slicing suppose if I have a    array let's suppose if I am going to    store this array inside a so he is    nothing but this element that I have has    an array now let's suppose if I wanted    to    access an element out of this particular    array so how I will be able to access    element out of this particular array so    I can try to write maybe a zero and if    I'm going to write zero I will be able    to get a judo throw that is completely    fine maybe if I can try to write zero to    a five so let's see what will happen so    whenever I have written zero to five    well let's see I am going to write here    - so you will be able to find out that    in case of a zero to two so it is giving    me a zero throw it is giving me a first    row excluding second row and I can try    to write zero of 2 over here you will be    able to find out that it is trying to do    a slicing operations and it is trying to    give me only this one so means 0 1 0 1    this is the meaning of this one so if I    have some data set even if I have a 3d    array I will be able to extract and    later I just have to write another axis    over here and it's completely fine    there won't be an issue I will be given    to get up data set very easily so this    is what happens guys I would say in    terms of for data slicing operation now    whatever operations that we have    discussed so far so for everything is    applicable even over here everything bit    by bit    everything is available even in this    particular please now what I can do is    so maybe I have array a over here now I    can try to write a greater than 5 so if    I am going to write a greater than 5 so    whatever element and wherever data I    have so if it is greater than 5 it is    going to give me true otherwise it is    going to give me false oh yes 705 so it    is giving me true over here rest of the    element will be equal to false now if I    am going to pass this data inside an    array itself what will happen it is    going to give me only those data which    is going to validate with this    particular condition so you can try to    write any kind of a condition as well    and for sure    you will be able to get a data based on    your given condition so it's completely    fine so I can just write a condition    just like a    and then I will be able to get a data    very easily now let's suppose if I    wanted to perform some kind of    assignment operation so a of maybe like    a 0 of 0 so I can try to perform    assignment operation as well so it's    completely fine if I am going to print a    as you can see on a 0 of 0 location it    has replaced this particular element so    if this proves that array is basically a    like a mutable element now so let's    suppose if I am going to perform or    let's suppose if I am going to create    some kind of an array M is equal to MP    array list of    so this is my M now I will do is I am    trying to get n na n is what okay so I    have basically I get two array over here    now if I am going to perform a M plus    one operation in plus n operation so in    this case what will happen so it will    try to perform this addition operation    it will try to perform this addition    operation index wise it is going to    perform element or like Windex wise    element operations over here now if I    will talk about M minus n so again index    wise it will try to perform the    operation let's suppose index of one    element is different and another element    is different in this case it is going to    give you an issue saying that ok so I    was expecting this and you have given me    some other elements so make sure that    whenever you are going to like a perform    this kind of operation so your array    dimension is always same now if I'll    talk about like M into M into and so    again this is not a matrix    multiplication this is basically a index    wise operation simple so index to index    it will try to like a perform this    multiplication operation so M cross n so    6 7 2 3 4 into 4 5 into 5 so yes    sushi 7 2 3 4 plus 4 I went to find and    so on so this is basically our index    wise operation it is trying to perform    matrix multiplication is completely    different for example let's suppose I    have one matrix M 1 on like I have an    element called as 0 1 2 3 this is the    element that I have then again I have    another matrix is M 2 let's suppose and    I am trying to perform like 2 3 1 8 this    is the element that we have M 1 and M 2    now if I am looking for a matrix    multiplication what I should    in that case I can try to imagine like    this with this so I can multiply 0 into    2 plus 1 into 1 then this with this I    can try to so this I will try to    multiply with this particular element so    it's completely fine so 0 into 2 and 1    into 1 I can try to multiply as you can    see that it's a 2 cross 2 element it's a    2 cross 2 element then I can try to    multiply this with this 1 so 0 into 3    plus 1 into 8 now so I can't element    like this with this one again so 2 into    1 plus 3 into 20 - 2 so here 2 into 2    plus 3 into 1 and then 2 into 3 plus 3    into 8 now if you will try to solve it    so 0 into 2 0 you will be able to get 1    over here and then 3 into 0 is equal to    0 you will be able to get 8 over here    and then 2 into 2 is equal to 4 plus 3    is equal to 7 and then 2 cross 3 cross 2    is equal to 6 and 8 into 3 is equal 24    so it will be equal to 30 so this is a    final matrix multiplication that you    will be able to receive now let's try to    do the same thing over here so here I    can try to write M 1 and M 1 is nothing    but so same element I am going to take    so now I got a double RA Y and I'm going    to take basically just off list so that    I will be able to convert it so do you    know comma 1 and then I can try to take    maybe like 2 comma 3 this is m1 now if    I'll try to print m1 this how it looks    like 0 comma 1 2 comma 3 same element    then if I have to calculate or if I have    to create maybe are empty m2 over here    so M 2 so m2 is nothing but so numpy dot    a double re ye array and then inside    that so I can try to create maybe our 2    3 so 2 comma 3 and 1/8 so I can try to    like output I would say 1 comma 8 so    it's completely fine M 2 is nothing but    this one now I don't want to do em into    so M 1 into M 1 into into M 2 if I am    trying to do m1 into m2 so I am able to    get 0 3 to 24 but no that is not an    answer which I have received by doing my    manual calculation so what I can do is I    can try to do em one at the rate and two    now you will be able to find out that    whatever manual calculation which I have    done and whatever result which I am able    to secure over here this result one    eight seven thirty I am able to get    exactly the same result by doing a    matrix multiplication so into is not a    symbol for a matrix multiplication into    is a symbol for index wise    multiplication if you have to do a    Marissa multiplication in that case you    can try to use at the rate symbol and in    this way you will be able to get a    matrix multiplication I am assuming that    you all know the rule of am interest    multiplication so suppose if I have like    M cross n matrix s and n cross P matrix    s so this two things will be same this    one should be same so if this one is    same then only you will be able to    perform a matrix multiplication means a    column of a first matrix and a row of a    second matrix s should always be same if    it is not same you will not be able to    perform a matrix multiplication if try    this out and the final matrix that you    will be able to get this is equal to M    cross P so I already had 2 cross 2 and 2    cross 2 so yes 2 is equal to 2 that is    completely fine finally I will be able    to get a matrix of to cross - so like a    2 cross 2 so yes I am able to get a    matrix of 2 cross 2 over here so    remember always guys like how matrix    multiplication happens    what does not come as a matrix    multiplication that is very much    important for you now addition    subtraction multiplication division well    suppose I wanted to give a power so m1    is a element which I have created now so    I wanted to give a power is equal to 2    so you will be able to find out that    this is the original matrix S now if I    have done a power W static miss power so    it is going to give like a 0 into 0 1    into 1 so 1 into 1 is equal to 1 2 into    2 is equal to 4 to be about 2 to the    power 2 is equal to 9 so yes it's a 9 so    this is what is the meaning of a power    that you will be able to give power wise    either try to keep her you can try to    use a power function as well it will do    the same thing so maybe they try to call    everyone and then you can try to give    maybe a 2 over here you will be able to    get a same result so both way it's    completely fine you can try to give a    power power - it can be loot as well    there won't be an issue at all that you    are going to face in any cases now so    let's sigh to perform some kind of    operation so here I am going to create    like let's suppose M I am going to    create NP dot j e r OS zeroes and I can    give 5 comma 6 or maybe like 3 comma 4    let's suppose so it's completely fine I    am able to get a data or like I am able    to get all the zeroes as 3 comma 4 so    like a three row and a four column and    you will to get it that is completely    fine this is what expectation is now if    I am going to perform like a M plus M    plus 1 or M plus 2 so it will try to add    this element on I can do a subtraction    as well I can do multiplication division    or any kind of arithmetic operation    there won't be an issue so I can try to    perform this kind of operation that    won't be any kind of an issue that you    are going to face that is completely    fine but this is called as a    element-wise    broadcasting operation means with    speak to every elements I'm trying to    broadcast mine a data that's I'm going    to add to in every element what if I'm    looking for a robust podcasting    operation or if I'm looking for a column    wise podcasting operation what I should    do in that case let's suppose so let's    try to perform this operation so I am    going to create m1 over here or let's    suppose N 1 I am going to create N 1 is    nothing but so MP dot a double RA Y and    in a single row I have basically like a    four-element    so maybe I can try to give 1 comma 2    comma 3 comma 4 maybe - it's fine if I    am going to execute it so it should work    fine so bracket and here it should be    bracket so fine here I have N 1 now what    is so I have N 1 as this one and I have    M as this so this one is the element now    what if if I am going to do n plus and 1    what will happen in this case let's    understand this you will be able to find    out that this time when I am trying to    provide a entire number of the data is    equal to total number of for data which    I have inside a single row so you know    first row I have 1 3 4 - it's completely    fine    so I'm going to try to provide this data    I'm trying to provide this data I am    trying to add these things with this one    so it is trying to perform a row wise    broadcasting operation last time when I    have just added one element so it was    trying to do element wise not casting    this time so when I'm trying to like add    this Plus this so it is trying to do a    row wise broadcasting operations by    default but customers it is trying to    perform the similar operation so 1 3 4 2    1 3 4 2 1 3 4 2 it has added with    respect to this one now    what if if I wanted to perform a column    wise podcast or what if if I have like a    more number of element over here in this    case what will happen there will be an    issue so if you are trying to do a    broadcasting operation so it will make    sure that save is always same if save is    not same for show    you will not be able to get out come so    fine sape is same now let's suppose what    if if I wanted to do a broadcasting    operation along with a row along with    the room if I were to do a broadcasting    operation so is it possible cause this    is that like a this is like horizontal    broadcasting operation suppose if I    wanted to do a vertical broadcasting    operations in that case how I will be    able to do it so if I have to perform    this kind of operation so maybe I can    try to create an umpire dot array and I    can try to give maybe like 3 comma 4    comma 5 that's what I mentioned it's a    three data set is available in one    single column or vertical like a way so    if I am going to exist and I can do this    kind of operations and let's suppose if    I am going to store these things into n    2 so n 2 is nothing but this one if I am    going to do like M plus n 2 it is going    to give me an issue because by default    this is nothing but itself horizontal    array array along X exists is equal to 0    so axis is equal to 0 along with that it    always try to create an array so what I    should do in that case maybe I can try    to do what transpose operation so I can    try to call doc T now so if I am going    to like    perform a transpose operation so what    what you have to do is just try to    perform a transpose operation and by    doing this transpose operation you will    be like able to transpose a data or you    will be able to rotate a data so make    sure that you are going to take our    two-dimensional data over here so as you    can see that it is able to perform a    transpose operation a vertical like    operation it is able to do and now if I    am going to perform a broadcast    operation so 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5    along with a vertical column so it is    able to and it or it is able to    broadcast it so this is something called    as a broadcasting and this is how    broadcasting is going to happen actually    so you will be able to do element or    broadcasting you will be able to do row    wise broadcasting because many times you    will try to face this kind of pressure    like I have to normalize my data I have    to advise my data    maybe I have to perform a similar kind    of operation on a millions of arrays at    a time a millions of the data at a time    so these are the broadcasting operation    which always like it's a handy operation    so you will try to do it and in that way    you will be able to perform a data    manipulation so vertically if you wanted    to add something you can add it    horizontally if you wanted to add    something yes you will be able to and it    there won't be any kind of issue that    you are going to face now what I can do    is I think try to maybe like a create an    array and NP dot random dot ranch and I    can try to give maybe a dimension of the    array 4 comma 5 so it's completely fine    so it is able to generate a 4 comma 5    random data then I can try to do maybe a    reshaped over here ress jpe    we save and for power 5 so i wanted to    cover in to 1 and costly so now 10 low    two columns it has generated some other    data and then i am trying to just    release a pitch it's completely fine now    what i will do is i will try to like her    take this as a and I can try to I can    try to like generate another random data    this is like I am I have and M is equal    to this one I can try to generate maybe    M 1 for sure it's a random data so it is    going to be different m1 Arjun M I have    generated so it's completely fine both    wait a sec is different now so if I    wanted to perform a square root    operation for all the elements what I    can do is I can try to call numpy dot    dot s q RT and m1 so in this case it    will try to perform or if you try to    give you a square root of every element    which is a playable inside m1 this is    what it does square root now so let's    suppose if you have to calculate our    exponent of every element so he X P and    you can try to mention m1 over here on    any matrixes this is nothing but it's an    exponent of the m1 data set that we have    created    the exponent so these are the function    which is available I'm just trying to    talk about our function over here    nothing else maybe if you want it to get    a log of every data set log so 10 log to    whatever you want so log of M 1 yes you    will be able to get along as well after    you dataset now let's suppose if you    wanted to like you have M 1 and you have    M as well if you have M as well over    here now let's suppose you wanted to    perform our division operation and you    want it to print like you want it to    print I would say a remainder so you can    try to type M and M 1 over here you will    be able to you will be able to find out    that it is giving me a remainder if    would does what so f would always try to    give up remainder let's suppose if I am    going to divide 10 by 3 what will be our    remainder    the amenda will be equal to 1 if I'm    going to divide 5 by 2 what will the    remainder matter will be equal to 1 or 7    by 5 if I am going to divide the matter    will be equal to 2 so this is just going    to give you a remainder    it will either divide this by this and M    by M 1 and then whatever will be the    remainder it will try to give you a    remainder as simple as that so this is    how this mathematical function is going    to work with respect to an array and    this is what I was supposed to discuss I    would say guys in today's class so keep    practicing I would say all those things    in a next class so I will talk about a    visualization so which is nothing but a    math problem    cufflinks Seabourn plotly so I'm going    to cover these libraries in terms of a    visualization you will be able to    visualize your data set I will talk    about how this visualization is    different from a visualization that we    used to do into a data analytics tool    like a power bi a chaplain or maybe W or    maybe a QlikView or something like that    so this is all about numpy now in numpy    there are thousands and thousands of    function which is available you should    not know about all the function these    are the basic function that should know    you know very first place    for sure you should practice all of    those functions that I've mentioned over    here and yeah after that for sure you    will be able to pick and choose any kind    of example or any any kind of use cases    and you will be able to debug those use    cases and you will be able to perform    all sort of data manipulation of data    addition subtraction or matrix    operations any kind of a matrix    operation or any kind of array operation    that you are looking for yes it is    possible to perform all of those are the    operation so now like a what I will do    is so I will try to take some of the    questions I think we have already    answered many questions like from our    side in your Q&amp;amp;A session so I will try    to take some of the live question from    here and if you have any kind of    combination combination you can try this    out by yourself and then we can go ahead    so fine guys I'm going to unmute couple    of you one by one you can start asking    question in our what I have a 2d array    it is a three four five six seven eight    and six seven nine the one that you have    used in example and is you have array    inside an array right okay so tell me    that you have just anything else and one    two three    okay fines people fighting and then like    one two three    fine and one more one more one more    airing okay so okay one more array you    want me to you okay yes now if I give    like the shape of this one okay this is    giving me some like different kind of    output I could not understand somewhat    of this so see this is my array and    right now if you are trying to give    shape right now what is the meaning of    shape say it means number of rows number    of column right here    so can I say that I have basically this    array and 0    one two do you know 1 2 so 3 cos 3    define the n-dimensional like I want to    convert it to attending like ending    equal to 10 you wanted to convert into    10 dimension right see same this depend    and I mention is different so suppose if    I am going to keep n dim over here D    lasso n dimension over here like so now    it will look like this one okay now you    this is the something that you are    looking for right okay so now C is going    to read this one so save means dimension    what is a total number of dimension that    you are given so certain of our    dimension is equal to 10 that we have    given and I will try to take my previous    array as well let's suppose so I will    try to take my previous array as well so    this one and let me I can name these    things as a n 1 over here so now N 1 is    this and here if I am going to print    n1 dot in 1 dot shape so it is trying to    give me a total number of row and put a    number of columns now what is the    meaning of total number of row and total    number of column so here can I say that    this is a two dimensional array it's a    two dimensional right if you will try to    print a dimension so what is the    dimension that is going to return can I    say that n 1 . + 1 . n dim it is going    to give it to two dimension now what is    the meaning of two dimension to    dimension means x coordinate and y    coordinate can say that x axis and y    axis so i will be able to represent my    array over here this is the meaning of    this already it's already what is the    meaning of three dimension the dimension    means i am trying to expand these things    into a gel axis as well right so it's    since i'm trying to add summary behind    array so one we have one array so just    try to understand in this way so what is    the meaning of three dimensions so    meaning of the dimension is nothing but    suppose i have this tiny night so I have    wandering I have wandering over here    right now if I'm going to check another    page over here so I am trying to get one    or behind another away right this is    called a theory so this one you want    punish people let me just have one D and    then behind    3d not tendon is one practical attendee    you will not be able to visualize it    right so 10 dimension is 1 so I have in    a virtual space in a virtual space I    have basically these many number of the    dimension these mean number of the    dimension I have now when I say what to    do over here but I say this is a 2d    array so with the help of x and y    coordinate I will be able to represent    it when I will try to say these things    as a 3d array it means in out breath in    in like an inert towards a jet axis also    I have some data so when I say 10    dimension so I can say that even into a    10 dimension I have some kind of a data    that's the region so you will be able to    get basically 10 element 10 I will miss    let's one by one let's try to understand    it suppose if I'm going to like create    this array    n1 and if I am going to reshape n1 in    this space so n1 dot please say I would    say into 1 Cross 3 cross 3 now what is    the meaning of this can I say that it    has converted these things into write    again if I am going to convert these    things one pass one pass body    knightly what is the meaning of 1 Cross    1 Cross 1 for 3 cos 3 1 cross means I    have basically an array and inside that    I have a array base in your 3 cos 3 what    if if I am going to convert these things    I have total like a 9 number of elements    let's suppose I am going to give this as    3 and this as 1 Cross 3 now what    happened you will be able to find out    that I have basically three array what    is the meaning of this theory I have    right means I have basically three array    of size 1 Cross 3 right I have basically    three array this is one array this is    another array several comma this is a    another array and what is the size of    every array 1 cos 3 right oh if you are    going to give a dimension so for sure    whenever you will try to print a save    right so same wise it is going to give    you 9 element itself you can write a    multiply everything    it will be nice means helmet has not    changed right the only thing is so it is    trying to add a timing    in that one so it is well previously    like we had a two dimension it has added    a bracket means it will keep on    increasing our dimension into a virtual    space that is a meaning of these things    it's exactly like a same thing I got    three dimensional two dimensional maybe    one D we used to create is it making    sense now    7 2 1 4 then we have taken a matrix    column wise addition sorry we have done    the conversion see a reshaping so each    suppose I have like a this one is a data    night and let's suppose if I am trying    to find out maybe let's suppose I am    going to perform this operation so    stop and again    okay so two four five of him okay do you    get oh yeah we have like a n2 and it's    completely fine and now this is how this    data set is now if I try to check a    shape of this data so let's suppose even    trying to check a shape of this data the    same one plus three right now what I    will do is I will try to do a reshape    and these shape means so I can try to    convert this thing to do 3 cross 1 right    already    I will paint these things so can I say    whatever I was able to achieve with the    help of again I am trying to achieve    exactly same thing with help of this one    and further if I wanted to do some kind    of processing I will be able to do it so    let's try to generate em over here done    so we reduce it object resume tomorrow    comma 3 or gonna basically going to give    just a vector over here you are not    going to give an element inside an    element now let's try to understand what    happens internally so suppose if I have    given this element right now if you will    try to check a shape of this one say is    nothing but 3 it is trying to give you    now if you will try to check basically    like n dot dim of these things so we    have like a n 2 so n 2 dot M di M so    basically it's a one dimension one    dimension is what so you are trying to    you are trying to add some element so    what is M so can I say that N is a two    dimension right and n is what n is one    dimension in one dimension you will not    be able to perform a array    multiplication operation addition    operation division operation subtraction    operation different dimension shape is    different thing so she buys if I have a    shape like a shape is like a dimension    in dimension is same because see what    happens is dilation can I say dimension    of M is equal to 2 only dimension of    this entire array is equal to 2 or e    right and even if I'll try to perform    this operation for dimension of even    this one is too can I say that nation is    too so shape is different but can I say    that dimension is same yes so whenever    you're trying to do our data addition    operation of multiplication operation or    division operation or any kind of    manipulation operation in terms of our    element fixes make sure that dimension    should always be same say is different    it's completely fine but dimension    should not generation means x y&amp;amp;z    coordinates in between you're trying to    do some kind of multiplication so that    should not be change at all and that's    the region so I have cut what are those    things into a like in dimension and then    I was trying to perform this addition    operation Virginia and there may still    be ship level 3 cross 1 car yes it will    be able to change the dimension for sure    so reshape is received is nothing but    Saudi ship always gets applied on any    kind of other rate so you can try to    reshape it from anything to anything    Pascal carry shaker notably children    exactly see whenever this is what I was    trying to explain your last case right    suppose if I have this kind of metrics    right as of now what is the dimension of    this matrix what is the dimension of M 3    dimension dimension also D 2 mu T right    it's a 2d basically to miss exercise    coordinate basically right now let's    suppose if I am trying to apply    basically Arisa function so can I say    that I can convert    I can change a dimension as well right    so maybe I can write apply V shape this    is AP over here are Chrisman reshape and    maybe I can try to give so one cross to    cross total number of element is 0.23 is    equal to L right so maybe I can give 6    over here or maybe I don't want to give    anything in that case I will be minus 1    can I say that I have change the    dimension by doing a recent operation    yes exactly right yes by doing or even I    can try to change these things into 10    dimension for dimension but what I'm    trying to say is so whenever you are    trying to do some kind of a primitive    operation with respect to our array so    dimension should always be same the data    element or like the matrixes on the    array that you have taken then only it    will be able to perform those kind of    operations you can try to    perform a matrix multiplication or    addition operation with a element which    is having a different dimension    physically damages should be same same    could be anything    generally people gets confused I hope    you find instead that damage should be    same and the same should set can be    different sometimes people buy    conditions same as a dimensional    dimension is safe so make sure that you    understand emissions animation and then    you can try to check in this way yeah    thank you sir NP dot line space may okay    NP dot line is base in P dot line space    so I just wanted okay what do you want    me to give three seven seven okay and    any any flooding number fine any protein    number you wanted me to give okay yeah    as possible think so so what is the    third element    no let's just try to understand this    upper angle function it is not going to    give you like an issue that is going to    give you warning right now why does    given your warning if you will try to    understand this particular signature of    the function so you will be able to find    out that it always look for starting    point it always look for my stopping    point agree and always look for the    number means here the number of the item    that you are trying to generate now    number of item you have given as point    five for five    do you think any item in this entire    world exists as a point four five oh    yeah according right never happen that    you'll ask you okay fine give me a    hundred rupees so what you will do even    just like so and so like if I ask you to    find give me one point four five rupees    at one point four five movies so you    will give me one rupees and then like I    you will try to tour this one Lupe's and    then give it to me no right    oh that's not yeah yeah the same thing    gets a buy dinner over here yeah thank    you    yeah next question please    okay fine guys I think like we are done    for today    all right so we have discussed this    numpy things done by is actually very    much important in terms of all    mathematical operation and you will not    be able to understand as significance of    numpy unless and until you are not into    a redesigns or machine learning or deep    learning because like if you are into    this area for sure you will keep on    using a number and I is like a some kind    of a things which should always help you    out like to debug your code or to    understand the entire neural network and    how training happens for is going to    bill the model what is a kernel inside    that one how like a data is trying to    calculate it how data is going to like a    bill which is trying to understand the    pattern data so everything everything    you will be able to understand and    everything happens inside and you'll    network in terms of India rain itself in    the area or number metrics on itself    so just try to understand this part and    again one more information like this    number is not only this much number    itself is a very huge package very use    package so there are thousands and    thousands of a function which is    available but at the same point of a    time you should not know all those    functions it's completely fine on a    requiring basis you will try to explore    you in tagalog but these are the basic    function which you should practice and    mission which you should know we have    all we are going to give you I think we    have already uploaded up and aspect    assignment and we are going to update on    my practice plus number assignments both    of these things we are going to update    and make sure that you are going to    complete your assignments and you try to    complete all of those the practice    session that we have given you probably    by tomorrow it will be updated and I    think we have already updated up and    asked so keep doing those things and    keep practicing those things next class    I will talk about matplotlib Seabourn    and cufflinks and plotly so till then so    thank you so much you learn in this    class and see you again in the next    class with that every day a night ahead</th>\n",

              "Columns: [hello do inaudible yes sir don't you hurt him okay fine yes sir    okay guys so I think in last class so I    was talking about up and dodge right do    not kill yourself um okay fine so in    this class I am going to talk about a    number package    okay fine guys so I think in last class    so I was talking about a pandas and we    have discussed many things in terms of a    pandas so in this class I will talk    about like what is numpy and what is the    uses of Mumbai package and what kind of    our data will be able to handle inside    of numpy so let's try to understand that    what is a number first of all so I'll    try to do an import over here so import    nu MV y as n V so here you will be able    to find out that I am trying to import    this uh numpy any MP wine so it's    nothing but a numerical Python so in    your means numerical and PI means Python    basically so this numpy was not    available inside a Python package or as    a part of a Python package I would say    so basically there is a tool I would say    a call as a Matt Hartley it's not a like    a like a MATLAB basically so there was a    tool called as a MATLAB not a Matt    product Matt Burnham is basically a    library for a visualization so MATLAB is    a tool which has been used for our    different different kind of a simulation    or different different kind of a    software testing or different kind of a    neural network as well so before like    like a five-year bag or 10 year back so    people have been using and even when I    was in my college life so I was trying    to write some kind of a paper at that    point of a time so even I have used a    MATLAB so metal app as a tool to build a    neural impulse so because at that point    of a time there was a notice of flow    there most are no firearms he knows or    cafe which was available as open source    so fine so basically that was our    numerical package which was available    inside like like MATLAB and what people    have done is so they have just    replicated the entire package inside a    Python same numerical package they have    duplicated over here keeping these    things in our mind that if we are trying    to do a signal processing or if we are    trying to do our email processing or if    we are trying to do any kind of a text    data processing as well so generally    system will be expecting a kind of array    or kind of a matrixes so unless and    until you will not be able to convert    your data in a form of arrays or in a    form of a matrixes you will not be able    to perform those kind of operations so    numpy is basically a numerical Python    package fear you will    dealing with majorly an array order    matrixes or mostly array because matrix    is a subclass of array itself so again    we have going to talk about like a    different different kind of operations    or different different kind of a data    manipulation with respect to a number    package plus a data conversion as well    so numpy package just understand arrays    or our matrixes and like I told you in a    very beginning that there is no such    array concept which exists inside a core    Python and yes that is true so far so    forth we have not seen even a single    array element in our discussion so there    is a list element which is available but    there is no array element which is    available so like I told you that term    this array kind of an element is    available inside a numpy and let's try    to discuss about that let's try to build    our understanding so here I am just    trying to import numpy because by    default this number libraries will not    be available in your current import or    in your current session once you are    going to import it after that for sure    it will be available so yes it is    allowed it's available and NP is nothing    but it's just a alias which I have given    so you can try to keep my name or you    can try to give your name doesn't matter    at all so it's just an abbreviation of a    numpy which I am trying to like take in    this particular place now what I will do    is let's suppose if I'm going to create    a list let's suppose a is a list and    then inside manage I have a 3 comma 4    comma 5 comma 6 this is the data now as    we know that if I am going to check a    type of this data so it is going to give    me basically a list of data it's come    really fine now what we can do and above    this one is so if I have to convert this    data into a array form it into our numpy    compatible array format so in that case    I can try to call NP which is nothing    but an alias of a numpy like we were    using alias for a fantasic is equal to    PD and then numpy dot a double are a    wide I can try to type over here and I    can try to give a value is equal to a    means I'm trying to pass list inside a    numpy not array if I am going to execute    it it's completely fine you will be able    to see our notation as an array over    here so this is a notation of a array    that you will be able to see so I have    converted    list into a any format in this way now    so here if I'll try to check a data type    of this one typ of this one so it's    basically a nd array so you will be able    to find out that it's a numpy compatible    n dimensional array so ndre means n    dimensional array it is trying to build    it for me so it's completely fine so I'm    able to build a array out of my data set    now what we are going to do is so now I    will be showing you our different    different kind of manipulation so here    it's a very basic thing like you will    take an array and then even take a list    and then you will be able to convert    those lists in terms of aw or in a form    of arrays it's completely fine plus what    we can do is so let's suppose if I am    going to take a list where I have a    integer and I have a floating-point    number    now what will happen if I am going to    take an integer so I have a 3 4 5 6 as    an integer and then then I have 1 so I    have basically a floating point number    over here now if I am going to execute    it it's completely fine    you will be able to see some kind of    changes in your output you will be able    to find out that it is trying to perform    up casting it is trying to perform up    casting automatically so we had just    three but it has converted these things    into three dot means a floating one    number so finally it has converted    everything into a floating one number    this is called a saw up casting so if    you are going to take some element    inside an umpire taught some element    inside and list as a floating point    number and if a rest of the element is    available into an integer by default    whenever you will try to convert your    data into an array it will try to    perform a AB casting this is something    which is going to happen by default you    don't have any control over to it again    in a later stage you will be able to do    a typecasting and you will be able to    convert all of your like a floating    point number into integer that is    possible but here so by default it will    be able to up cast your data set again    otherwise if I can talk about so NP dot    a double are a while and maybe I can try    to pass unless Ted list over here so I    can try to pass a list of a list over    here so this is a list    like that I have 1 comma 2 comma 3 and I    have another list let's suppose so I    have another list and in this list let's    suppose I have a 3 comma 4 comma 5 if    I'm going to execute it so again it has    converted my data into a array inside    array so basically I have two array    inside one single array this is how you    will be able to understand it so I have    an outer array and inside that I mean I    have a to array or if you will try to    understand in a layman way you can try    to understand in this way that here so    we have 0 1 2 and here we have 0 1 so we    have to row and we have 3 columns let's    suppose if I have to access this element    so how I will be able to access this    element if I'm going in to give a    coordinate or if I'm going to give like    indexes of 0 0 I will be able to access    1 if I'm going to act like a give 0 1 I    will be able to access this one this is    how you are supposed to understand on    numpy array or n dimensional array so    let's try to do it and let's try to    understand it so let's suppose I am    going to stall is store this particular    value inside a variable called as B and    this is V is nothing but this one now if    I am going to write V of V of 0 then I    will be able to get this entirely first    element V of 0 means zeroth row I am    able to access now if I am going to give    V of 0 of 0 this is what we have    discussed so far sure you will be able    to get this one 0 of 1 so this one 0 of    2 this one so this is how you will be    able to get a data you will be able to    access a data from numpy array so if you    have a multi-dimensional array this is    how I will be able to access a data    apart from that apart from that so if I    will try to check if I'll try to check V    dot as such ap safe of V now what is the    meaning of safe safe means number of Rho    and number of columns so safe is a    inbuilt function which is available    inside a numpy so suppose if I'm going    to call shape of this data this    pertinent data so as we know that we    have a tube we have two row so that's    the reason we are able to get to this    one and this one and we have basically    three columns so we are able to get    these three as simple as that so this is    what safe is going to return and this    concepts are very basic but at the same    point of a time    a significance of this concepts are very    much high one once you will try to    process your images or maybe some kind    of sensor data some kind of a textual    data into our deep learning with the    help of a neural network or even into a    machine learning you will be able to    understand that in a core in a heart of    each and every processing so it is    trying to convert everything into a    numerical array format or a number array    format and then it is trying to process    it so again so some time it is going to    give you some kind of a shape issue or    some time it is going to give you some    kind of a format issue    so unless and until you don't know an    umpire in a better way you will not be    able to debug all of those things so    fine guys I am able to get a safe over    here now what I will try to do is so B    dot R dim I can try to execute or let's    suppose I am going to create one array    so in B dot a double are a Y array and    then inside that so maybe I can try to    keep some kind of an element so if I am    going to execute it this is the simple    array which I am able to get now if I    look into this array function you will    be able to find out that number of    dimension which is given dimension is    given over here so by default dimension    will be equal to 0 now let's suppose if    I wanted to keep dimension so ending is    equal to so ending is equal to let's    suppose if I am going to give two now    what will happen in that particular case    let's try to understand it sometime so    it's completely fine if I am going to    give dimension is equal to two so in    that case you will be able to find out    that it is trying to give me to bracket    over here it is going to give me into    bracket over here this is what happens    in case of a number of dimension is    equal to two now let's suppose if I am    going to give a dimension is equal to 20    you will be able to find out that it is    replaced at 20 bracket before and 20    bracket after whenever you will try to    do image processing these    things are very much important because    if I'll talk about a matrix    multiplication because this is what    happens in general into a new liberal    network so if I'm talking about a matrix    multiplication so unless and until you    are very sure about these kind of a    concept you will not be able to do lots    and lots of time a debugging where you    will be able to get an issue for sure so    I will be able to change a dimension as    well for a particular array so if I have    a array maybe having a one dimension so    I can try to change these things into a    two dimension or into a three dimension    or into a multiple dimension doesn't    matter at all now so I can try to create    a array NP dot a double RA Y and then    maybe I can try to give a list we have    already seen that how I can try to    change a dimension now so I can try to    change data type as well data type is    equal to maybe I can try to write    complex so in a very first class we have    seen that complex number is a kind of a    number where you will be able to get a    real data type plus you will be able to    get some kind of imaginary data type and    for imagine a data type notation will be    equal to J suppose I have this data type    1 plus like a 2 J so 1 is nothing but    it's a real number whereas 2 is nothing    but it's a imaginary factor and J is    nothing but it's a notation it's a    notation for a imaginary number or a    complex number altogether you can say so    it's completely fine if I wanted to like    convert all the data into a complex    number so as we can see that complex    part is equal to 0 complex we don't have    a complex part as of now so what will    happen in this case is it is going to    add a complex number by the factor of 0    over here so still data is same the only    thing which I have done over here is so    I have changed a data type in this    particular place and I will be able to    get a complex number as simple as that    this is what you will be able to get    again so in last example let's suppose    if I am going to take like a 1 list one    list with our 3 number and other list I    have which is having like a 2 number if    I am going to    and what these things you will not be    able to get a proper array it will be    able to convert into a n dimensional    array a multi-dimensional array so only    in a case of if you're all the list    element is having a same kind of a sale    if safe is different if length of the    list is different so in that case you    will end up getting this kind of a data    so most of you are going to get this    kind of a result for sure this is a    normal result I would say this is what    you can expect so it will not be able to    convert you an entire list into a array    yes that will be another but it will not    be able to convert these things into a n    dimensional array unless and until size    of the list that you are going to take    inside an array is not equal to say in    case of a multi-dimensional array then    you are going to pass a multiple list    only in that case I would say so fine    until this point so we have discussed    now let's try to understand one more    thing so I'm going to take an array so    maybe I can try to write like an NP a    double are a double rvy over here and    then I can try to take one list in this    particular case just try to focus over    here for some time so I am trying to    take like a 3 comma 4 and then I can try    to take maybe like a 5 comma 6 over here    that is completely fine so I'm trying to    take a red over here and take basically    like a list which I'm trying to convert    into an array it is completely fine I'm    able to do that but insider list so    instead of taking a list and I have    taken tuples so it's completely fine if    I am going to execute it I will be able    to convert this entire data into a    arraign this is actually array so    whenever you are going to pass a list of    the tuples or list of the list in both    the cases you will end up getting this    kind of a data without any even but it's    completely fine you will be able to get    it now one more thing I wanted to    discuss over here so in last example I    was trying to give data type is equal to    complex you can try to keep data type is    equal to integer or maybe a string you    can try to pass maybe a floating point    you can try to pass here I will be using    something different something completely    different I am going to use so data type    and    data type is equal to maybe I can try to    mention unlist over here and then I can    try to mention like add two tuples over    here so just like a two pass that we    have chicken in this particular place    and in a first tuple what I will do is    so in a first tuple I can try to say    that okay so a so I can try to say a and    a comma and again a common lesser than I    for this is the new things this is a new    notation that you will be able to get    and in the second one what I can do is I    can try to write like a B over here and    B comma and then I can try to mention    maybe lesser than equal to a to lesser    than I - I can try to mention so so far    so far so far so forth you must have    seen that I was talking about a integer    I was talking about a floor I was    talking about a STR I was talking about    a boolean and complex and a different    different kind of a primitive data type    that is completely fine there is no like    a if and but with respect to that but    here and trying to define a data type in    big defend me Here I am trying to define    data type in a completely different way    and I think this is not a approach that    we have seen so far so forth what is the    meaning of that let's try to understand    it what is the meaning of this    particular datatype notation so here as    you can see that you have taken    basically a list and inside a list so    you have a tuple so we have basically a    list of the tuple element that is    completely fine inside every tuple I    have two elements so I have like element    a I have a element B let's suppose I can    have a element a element B just for the    reference I'm trying to talk about that    now here what we have done is so as a    data type so we have mentioned a is    equal to i4 now there is no such a which    exists for sure it's just a reference    means whatever element that we have    inside a tuple    it will try to clear that as a a b c d    whatever you want to take just take it    there won't be an issue    again over here so I have taken B means    whatever data which I have available    inside a tuple so we will try to take    these things as a B so it's completely    fine we have taken a and B so it will    try to consider this as a this as B    this as a this as be fine now for a we    have defined this as a data type for B    we have defined this as a data type this    is what I am trying to perform this is    what I am trying to do over here so for    a I for is a data type and for B so    basically i2 is a data type let's try to    verify that what is a meaning of this I    for and what is the meaning of this I to    which I am going to consider so what    kind of a data type this I for and i2 is    I will try to understand that particular    part so if I am going to execute it it's    completely fine I am able to get my    array along with my data type so the    syntax wise there is no issue there is    no problem I'll try to store these    things maybe into a variable called as    end so let's try to restore these things    inside the valuable call as in and then    what I will do is I will try to access a    data in off zero so in of zero means but    so let's suppose if I am going to    execute this part let's suppose if I am    going to execute just this particular    part so I'm supposed to pass a bracket    over here so if I am going to execute    this part so if I have to access this    element this element is available at 0    of 0 position 0 1 0 1 so 0 of 0 I will    be able to access this 3 so what I will    do is I will try to access this 3 and    then I will try to check its data type    so that I will be able to understand a    meaning of iPhone just try to focus over    here of a 5 minute because you will not    be able to understand this particular    mapping if you are not going to focus    for at least 5 minutes    so here I will try to access basically 0    of 0 if I am going to execute it I am    able to get this particular 3 it's    completely fine I am able to access it    but it's complete like I'm not    interested in to just our access of the    data I am interested in to like a dinner    time so typ e t YP I can try to type    over here and you will be able to find    out that it is representing I integer    32-bit it is trying to present int L    32-bit let's suppose I will try to    access 4 so 4 is nothing but 0 of 1 so I    can try to do a type of n of I would say    like a 0 of 1 and    in this way you will be able to find out    that it's representing idea 16 now what    is a meaning of this so as we have    already discussed that it will try to    map this first element of a tuple with a    and a second element of tuple will it be    for a element means for three we have    given a tonight is equal to i4 now when    I am trying to check this data time it's    basically representing an integer 32-bit    and when I am trying to check at it a    type of B means a B element so it is    trying to give me integer 16 so inside    an numpy you will be able to find out it    we don't have only our integer we have    integer 16-bit we have integer 32-bit    and we have an integer 64-bit as well so    here you will be able to find out a    primitive data type off data time so    it's not only an integer so far so forth    even in other programming languages you    will be able to find out just a data    type but here you will be able to find    out that it is possible to create our    integer just with a 16-bit just with the    32-bit or just with the 64-bit and again    it depends upon the big endian and    little-endian notation so I think if you    are faster from the computer science    background so you will be able to    understand this big-endian or    little-endian notation or you might have    heard about this particular word called    as big-endian or little-endian notation    so based on that since this data type is    been defined so based on the system so    maybe I can try to take digital type but    again it's not a major concern I would    say so just for the information so I am    just trying to like give you this kind    of example so that you will be able to    understand that there is not only    integer data type which is available    there is a 16-bit there is a pretty two    bit and there is a 64-bit which is    available now let's suppose if I am    going to change this things to eight now    what will happen in this case you will    be able to find out that not 64-bit    basically so i8 is going to represent    this is just a notation so i8 is    representing 64-bit let's suppose if I    am going to make these things as a    sixteen so what will happen in that case    there is an error so it will not be able    to understand    so who is available for is available and    eight is available so these are the 10    today which is available to simply means    that I'm talking about a 16-bit for    simply means that I am talking about    32-bit and it simply means that I am    talking about a 64-bit so this is how    you will be able to convert or you will    be able to get a different different    kind of integer data type itself with    respect to a bit or a bit respect to a    big-endian or little-endian notation now    so in my life I have never used this    particular notation while doing a data    processing but if you are going to    develop some kind of algorithm or maybe    if you are going to write a code which    just depends upon the 16-bit computation    or maybe a 64-bit computation or maybe a    34 bit computation at that point of a    time this kind of a concept may be handy    but as far as this data processing is    concerned or model building is concerned    into a image with respect to image or    maybe like textual data or maybe with    respect to a tabular data data frame so    you are not going to encounter these    things are frequently so it's completely    fine so just for the information so I    have shown you these particular things    now let's suppose let's suppose I wanted    to build a matrix data type so matrix is    basically a data type which is available    inside a number package I can try to    create it it's very easy so what I can    do is I can try to call n P dot ma T so    you will be able to find out that Matt    is something which is available inside    of numpy package what I can do is I can    try to do the selection operation and    then I can try to pass maybe a list over    here let's see what happens so if I am    going to pass a very simple list a    similar kind of full list which I have    passed inside my array now you will be    able to find out that my data type is    not array my data type is basically a    matrix S so matrix is a subset or    subclass of a array so Allah is a super    class inside numpy and matrix is a    subclass of that particular a child    class of a array if I am going to check    a type of this so for sure it is going    to    me our metrics data type as expected so    numpy dot matrixes so it's a did a type    of the sack type like matrixes you will    be able to get it so this is completely    fine now what I will try to do is so I    will try to perform some kind of    operation so there is something called    as a numpy dot as any array as any    airing now so what is the meaning of    this as any airing and what it does    basically so as we have already seen in    our previous example that if I am going    type numpy dot a double RA Y dy and if    I'm going too fast maybe list over here    it will give me array if I am going to    call so let's suppose I have creditor    matrixes over here and if I am going to    store this matrixes em inside a variable    M so this is my matrix data type as of    now now if I am going to pass this M and    inside NP dot array a double ROI and    then if I'm going to pass em over here    so if I am going to pass a list element    it is going to convert into array if I    am going to pass a matrix element it is    going to convert an element into array    so in both the cases in case of our list    or in case of a matrixes in both the    cases it is able to convert my data in a    form of array that is come really fine    but what does any array bin do so let's    try to understand this thing that's the    reason so I have given you these two    examples so here what this will try to    do is so let's suppose if I am going to    pass let's suppose if I am going to pass    a list over here so list Y is 5 comma 6    comma 7 comma 7 th so it is able to    convert into an array that is completely    fine but what if if I am going to pass    my matrix inside this one MP dot or like    as any array so as any arraign and what    is my matrix element m so what if I am    going to pass my matrix s over here so    you will be able to find out that no    this time it is not trying to convert    this time it is not trying to convert    into an array last time in this case    in this case I was trying to pass a list    convert it into array I was trying to    pass a metric says convert it into array    but this time when I am trying to pass a    list yes it is able to convert these    things into array but when I am trying    to pass a metric says in as any array it    is not trying to convert it so what is    the definition of this as any hurry    diffusion of as any erases that if if my    data set is available in some form if my    data set is available in some form of    the array I will not try to convert it    if my data set is available if - it will    not be available in some form of numpy    array so then only I will try to do a    conversion so as we all know that list    is not an element which is which is like    array this is not an array like an    element this is something which exists    inside a Python core so that's the    reason so it is trying to convert into    array but like I told you    matrix is nothing but it's a subclass of    array itself so matrix is re actually    matrix is a type of the array or matrix    is an instance of any instance miss    object of array I would say so matrix is    already a instance of array so in that    case it will not try to do a conversion    that this is what as any array is trying    to do for sure if you have to convert    something into array you can try to call    numpy array or number not as array here    are the two function which is available    but II if I don't want to convert some    element which is already in some form of    arranged so in that case I can try to    use as any array so only it will try to    do a conversion only if my data set is    not available in any form of array a    simple logic a simple concept over here    now again I don't try to remember any of    this function which I am trying to talk    about forget about everything don't    remember anything just try to practice    it and with practice you will be able to    learn many more things I would say now    next thing which I am going I'm going to    talk about is a deep copy and a solid    copy what is the meaning of a deep copy    and what is the meaning of a hollow copy    now this deep copy and swallow copy    concept is available in almost every    programming    languages so let's try to understand it    that what is what I'm trying to prove    over here and how I'm trying to perform    deep copy operation and a solid copy a    patient so let's suppose what I will do    is I will try to create a variable    called as a is nothing but so numpy a    double are a wide array and then inside    that so I can try to pass maybe a 4    comma 5 comma 6 comma 7 comma 8 it's    completely fine and then what I will do    is I can try to create a variable V and    B is equal to 8 it's completely fine now    so then what I will do is I will try to    access B you will be able to find out    that I have created a variable a and    inside a variable a I have these    elements and trying to perform a    reassignment operation means B is equal    to a means whatever element we have    inside a a so we will be having a same    element what happens inside a memory so    whenever I am going to create like a    variable a so it is going to take one    place and then here it is trying to    refer this like it is going to refer to    this variable and then inside that it is    going to call 4 comma 5 comma 6 comma 7    comma 8 as simple as that now whenever I    am trying to perform this assignment    operation so in that case this B will    always refer to the same location so my    a and B by doing this operation is    trying to refer to the same location so    whenever I am trying to call this B it's    not really fine I'm able to get a same    element whatever element I had inside a    I am able to get a same kind of an    element over here now what is the    meaning of this deep copy and swallow    copy let's try to understand let's    suppose if I am trying to access V of 0    V of 0 so we observe is nothing but the    zeroth element it's completely fine now    if I try to modify an element which is    available at 0th position so maybe    instead of using for I wanted to use    this number on instead of using up for    on a geolocation so this assignment    operation is completely fine I am able    to assign a new element on a 0th indexes    that is completely fine now if I would    and if I print this B yes this is a and    changes which I have done this is the    data manipulation which I have done if    I'm going to call a so with respect to a    I have not done a changes but as B and a    both is referring to a same location    because I have done B is equal to a    operation so in this case it will try to    change a as well so it will change B as    well as it will try to change a a so    whenever whatever modification you will    do in a it will be reflected in B and    whenever you would like to do some kind    of a changes into B it will be reflected    into a because both is trying to point    to the same location what if if I don't    want to do it what if if I am looking    for some kind of an element there    initially element will be same but    whenever I am trying to make a changes    into one element it should not make a    change into other element in this case    both is referred to the same location so    if I am going to change in one valuable    it is going to reflect a same changes    into other variable because location is    same like it is trying to point to the    same location now what I will do is I    will try to create another variable on a    C and inside a see I can try to call    numpy I would say that Co py copy and    here I will try to pass a it's    completely fine now what will happen in    this particular case so here when I am    going to create a variable C so it's    completely fine it will try to create a    reference variable C now what is a value    which I am trying to assign so I am    trying to assign a value which is    available inside now a as of now this is    the value which is available inside or    in after modification for sure so here    in P dot copy so what this copy command    will do so it will not try to point out    to the same location it will try to    reserve a new location for you it will    try to point means this variable is    going to point to this new location and    then it will try to copy this data from    here to here so here I will be having a    data now now what will happen so now    suppose if I am going to make some    changes so C is equal to this data and a    is equal to this day    means in C and in a in both the location    I have a similar kind of a data in both    the location I have exactly same data    set which is available so okay so here    you will be able to find out that in C    and in a I have exactly same data    because I have done copy basically so    copy or data from A to C this is what I    have done now if I'll try to modify    something in C suppose if I am trying to    modify something in C so C of 0 C of 0    is 535 maybe I can try to assign some    different like a number over here and    then if I am going to print C so it has    changed C for sure so previously it was    535 now itself 343 simple so it has made    the changes there is no even but with    respect to back if I'll try to print a    now it has not done a changes with    respect to a or vice versa if I am going    to make some changes into a you will be    so a of 0 maybe this kind of a number    and if I am going to print a this is    something that it has done but if I'll    try to print C it is not going to    reflect a same changes into C so here Y    it is not differently changes because    location where my C is trying to point    and the location where my a is trying to    point is completely different    so when I have done copy operation numpy    not copy so I have copied this entire    data from this location this location so    whatever I am going to perform over here    will be independent of the operation    which I am going to perform in this    particular place so this is what happens    so basically the approach which I have    used in this one the approach which I    have used over here to assign a value so    this particular approach is called as a    deep copy and this particular approach    is called as a swallow copy this is    something and this is how you are    supposed to understand it so this is    called as a swallow copy and this is    called as a deep copy in case of a deep    copy if you are going to make a    in one valuable it will not reflect a    change into other variable but in case    of a solo copy so well if you are going    to change one variable it will try to    reflect a same kind of a changes into    other variables as well so this is what    you are you should know I would say so    it's completely fine now moving ahead    and let's try to understand that how and    what in all different different kind of    a function which is available insider    number so let's let's try to understand    it so I can try to call basically a    function called as numpy dot from    function so from function I can try to    call now so what this from function does    let's try to understand it so I can try    to call like I can try to create lambda    over here so lambda is going to take    maybe x and y and then it is going to    perform I would say like X is equal    equal to Y operation and then I can try    to be maybe a dimension so 3 comma maybe    a 4 I can try to give if I am going to    execute it this is what I will be able    to get so in numpy every time whenever    you are going to get some kind of an    output every time you will be able to    get some kind of array or some kind of a    matrixes whatever function you are going    to use that is a speciality of a numpy    that you will be able to find out now so    here what I have done so here I am    trying to use numpy dot from function    now what is trying to do so from a    function it will try to generate some    kind of any so far so forth I have been    using like a NP dot array or maybe NV    dot as array or NP dot as any array or    NP dot map so these are the function    that I have been using so far so forth    it's completely fine now if I am going    to use this strong function kind of a    thing so in that case it will try to    generate this particular array based on    the function which I have given over    here    now in this particular place you can try    to write your external function you can    try to call your channel function or you    can try to write your lambda function as    we have already discussed about the    lambda function in our previous classes    so when I was talking about a map I was    talking about a reviews or I was talking    about like many things in other places    so I talked about or I have discussed    about a lambda function for sure so it's    completely fine not an issue    so here what this lambda function is    trying to do so here you will be able to    find out that this lambda function is    trying to take two argument and it is    trying to perform X is equal equal to Y    I have given dimension is equal to 3    cross 4 so when I'm trying to give a 3    cross 4 it means I am trying to create    an array of 3 row I would say and 4    column this is what I am trying to do so    this is a dimension which I have given 3    cross 4 0 4 column I have given now I am    trying to write like XY so you will try    to take two valuable - argument XY is    equal to X is equal to Y and then based    on this function and in this array so it    will try to give you a final matrix or    final array let's try to understand this    part so here what it will do is it will    try to match a column and a row and    column value so 0 is equal equal to 0    here we are trying to do X is equal to Y    so X is nothing but this one Y is    nothing but this one so 0 is equal equal    to 0 yes it's true    0 is equal to 1 false 0 is equal to 1 to    2 false 0 is equal to 1 2 3 Falls 1 is    equal to 0 false 1 is equal to 1 to 1 is    equal to 2 false false false false true    false this is the same output you will    be able to find out over here so it is    trying to give you on it is trying to    generate a data based on this function    so function that you have written on top    of some kind of a dimension because like    I told you so numpy dot array always try    to give you some kind of array except    array it is not going to give you any    other things so fine guys this is what    like I am able to get in this particular    please so I'm able to get basically our    data out of this particular function so    it's completely fine now what I will do    is I will try to write maybe some other    kind of a function as well so I can try    to copy the same thing and I can try to    write maybe X plus y now let's see what    happens in case of X plus y so here if    I'm going to write express fire logic is    not going to change at all so what it    will do is so it is going to take 0 1 2    because it's the 3 cross 4 so 0 and 0 1    2 3 so 4 column now I have written X    plus y X plus y if I've written so 0    plus 0 0 0 plus 1 1 0 plus 2 2 and 3 1    plus 0 1 1 plus 1 2 1 plus 2 is equal to    3 1 plus 3 is equal to 4 2 plus 0 2 2    plus 1 3 2 plus 2 4 2 + 3 5 it's an    exact same data you will be able to get    even over here this is how it is going    to give you a data base on the row and    column condition that you have written    so here I have written like a plus    operation and last time I have written    basically a boolean operation so true    and false kind of operations I have    written in a last cases so it's    completely fine guys again this is like    how I will be able to perform our data    manipulations over here not an issue now    what I can do is I can write maybe like    any kind of other things over here like    a minus plus division subtraction maybe    X minus y into let's suppose 6 I can    write whatever I want so there won't be    any issue and based on that I will end    up generate enough array so this is just    a function by which you will be able to    generate a array where on your logic the    logic that you are going to write now    the next thing which I am going to    perform or the next thing which I am    going to do so what I can try to do is    suppose if I have a string so I have    used n P dot from function now NP dot    from string I can try to use and then I    can try to pass maybe a string over here    so maybe I can try to pass like one    space three space a fight something like    that if I am going to pass this is    basically    string I've enclosed my data within a    string you will be able to find out and    then what I can do is separate otherwise    I can try to write like separator is    equal to a space if I am going to    execute it so it will try to take this    string you'll try to take this string    and then it will try to separate my data    based on the space because by default    separator will be equal to space so even    if I'm not going to mention these things    I think it will work fine now here so I    have used basically string my separate    is a comma so I am supposed to mention    separator is equal to comma if I'm not    going to mention it will not be able to    separate it and as you can see so yes    after separation so I am able to get a    data maybe I can try to pass some kind    of SUV edge and comma K um in are    something like that and in this case    what you will be able to get as nothing    it's a blank data that you will be able    to get let's try to understand that    whether I will be able to change at a    time or not so data dty PE is equal to    STR so if I am going to mention    something like that so here you will be    able to find out that it is not able to    understand this particular thing it is    trying to give me an issue that 0 valued    item size so whatever item that you are    trying to mention over here no it's not    able to like understand this item if I'm    going to give 6 comma 7 again it is not    able to understand suppose if I am going    to give integer now it is able to    understand basically so datatype eyes    and trying to pass a integer and then    I'm trying to pass a separator data wise    I am trying to pass a string so if you    try to read this string it will try to    separate it and finally it is going to    give you integer AHA array over here so    likewise you can try to perform like any    kind of a permutation combination and    you will be able to get a similar kind    of data now the next thing which I am    going to perform over here is so let's    suppose if I am going to create array a    basic array I will try to create so    or that I will try to create a nested    list maybe so 3 comma 4 comma 5 and then    maybe I can try to use like 6 comma 7    comma 8 comma 8 and timing should be    same otherwise it is going to give you    an object off a list this comma 7 comma    9 and I can try to close it now in P dot    a double rdy array a so I'm trying to    convert this data the data that I had    over here into this particular form into    a form of array so I am able to convert    my list into an array not an issue so I    will try to store these things inside a    variable called as n should be envied so    yeah so I'm trying to convert these    things into a array now what I will do    is I will try to show you our basic    operations over here so if I am wanted    to know that what is a dimension of this    particular array so as we can observe    that dimension of this particular array    is nothing but it's a two dimension but    I still I wanted to print it so n dot I    can try to type nd I M so I will be able    to get that dimension of this array is    equal to two now so at the time of    creation of a arrays so I have like    ending parameter now if I am going to    overwrite this parameter and if I am    going to mention dimension is equal to    ten what happens in this case so for    sure it is going to attach a 10 square    bracket in front of my data so as you    can see and then if I'm going to check    it's a ten dimension but by default so    by default the dimension of this array    is equal to I would say two and this    information is very much important this    is a small information it's completely    fine but when we try to do a    mathematical computation a mathematical    calculation in between a metric says so    you are going to get an issue because if    dimension of the data is not same so you    are going to face many problems many    kind of problem and then you will have    to go for the reshaping of the data but    again in what kind of re shape are like    what kind of reshape you will be able to    do you will be    to get all the information by following    this approach itself so it's completely    fine I am able to get a dimension there    is something called as a size so n dot    size if I am going to compute size means    what size means a total number of an    element inside this particular array or    a matrixes    ever is going to work on array same    thing we'll walk into a matrixes as well    so sighs sighs always talk about a    number of the element now I can try to    tie maybe a shape safe is nothing but a    row into columns as you can see I have a    three rows and three columns inside my    data so in by n or n cross M so whatever    is a size of your matrix is number of    rows and number of columns that you have    inside a matrixes so shape is going to    give you that one so it is going to tell    me that okay fine so like a shape of    this particular array is nothing but    itself 3 cross 3 and slice always give    you like a number of element my men    shall always try to give you that what    is a dimension whether my array is a one    T or maybe a 2 D or maybe a zero    dimension so maybe I can try to create    this array so M is equal to NP dot a    double re why array and then inside that    maybe I can try to pass 5 comma 6 comma    7 over here and m dot ending if I am    going to check it's a one dimensional    array I would say so suppose if I am    going to remove these things I'm going    to put just a bracket it's a one    dimensional array so by default if you    are your array is even blank so in that    case it will be a one dimensional array    that you will be able to get so 1 D 2 D    3 d 4 D this kind of array that you will    be able to get now so there is another    thing which you should know so suppose    if I wanted to know that what is our    data type of an array because data type    of the entire array will be same like we    have already seen that even if a single    data which is available inside your    array is in a float it will try to    convert even try to upcast    every data set which is available inside    the array so D type and you will be able    to find out that the entire data which I    have inside my array is having 32 now if    I wanted to override    I can try to override it maybe I can try    to keep my all the element as a 16-bit    or maybe as a 64-bit or maybe as a    64-bit or maybe as a 16-bit so it's    completely fine we talked about like an    eye - we talked about eye for we talked    about I ate so that is a way if you are    going to define data type is equal to I    to or I ate or maybe I four so in that    way you will end up converting your data    into a 16-bit 32-bit or 64-bit but by    default yes this is what you will be    able to receive so fine guys these are    the full function that you should    remember so that will help you out to    check your array and accordingly you can    try to go for the modification next    thing which I will be talking about is    called as a arrange function so I think    we talked about arrange function so RNG    this is a function that we have    discussed in a very beginning and if I'm    going to pass five so we all know that    it is going to generate a data in    between zero to five excluding five    excluding upper boundary now let's    suppose if I am going to give five dot    means five as a floating point number so    in this case it is going to give me an    issue it is telling me that no I can't    accept putting one number    I only take integer so even as an    initial point even as a final point if I    am going to give or even as a step size    if I am going to give maybe like a    floating point it is going to give me a    similar kind of issue so range function    is a function which always accepts a    integer it is not going to accept    anything else except integer at any    point of time this is how I would say    entire range function is been designed    so it's completely fine guys so you will    be able to use in only a integer in this    particular case you will not be able to    use anything else except a integer now    now what I should do so now if I have to    like take maybe like a floating point    and based on that if I have to generate    a data so in that case I will not look    for the range function what I can do    I can try to call numpy dot a range    function so erage is something which is    available inside a number inside that I    can try to pass maybe 0.5 it's    completely fine I can try to like get a    data I can try to like keep upper    boundary as a nine point eight seven    let's suppose this is the upper boundary    it is not going to complain me it's    completely fine maybe I can try to eat    initial point as 12.5 and 2.5 as an    initial point and then this is a final    point and the size of the steps are    nothing but 0.5 so you know point 5 if I    am going to give not an issue it's    completely fine so it will be able to    accept a floating-point number as an    initial point as a final point and as a    step size and it will be able to give    you a data set so this is something that    you will be able to experience with    respect to our image function so arrange    function I would say always works with    the integer as well as it is going to    work with the floating point number but    if I'll talk about just arrange    functions where each function is only    going to work with respect to all    integer it is never going to work with    the floating point number so I think we    are good with like a these operations    that we have done and again once you    will be able to get a data with the help    of our image function so what ever data    slicing operations are indexing    operations that we have discussed so    same data slicing operation similar kind    of a data indexing operations you will    be able to achieve even with respect to    this image function exactly the same    thing if you have to do some kind of a    reverse maybe column 4-1 or something    like that you will be able to do and you    will be able to reverse your data you    will be able to like a slice your data    set so fine guys this is what I like I    have to discuss with you now the next    function that I can talk about is called    as a numpy dot and again    that it is always going to give you how    array now if I have to convert this    array into a list I can do that as well    so maybe I can try to store these things    inside N and then I can try to call a    list function inside that I can try to    pass n as an array I will be able to get    a list this is the list but it is going    to return you up okay so inside an    umpire package whatever you are going to    get you will be able to get each and    everything just as an array nothing else    you will be able to get so it's    completely fine    you    hey guys let's start discussion this    thing so fine I was talking about the NH    function now what I can do is I can talk    about Harnam Phi dot line space function    little I any blank space function okay    now what will happen in this case    so line is faces are another function    which you can use to generate a theta so    let's try to understand that how you    will be able to generate my data with a    line space function so you can try to    give me a initial point you can try to    give maybe a final point and then in    this case this is not same as a range    function on a range function range and    ingredients both are same the only    difference is a range is a part of a    Python whole area is a part of her numpy    and the second difference is a range can    only consider integer    whereas a range consider floating point    as well as integer now here there is a    function called as line space now what    this line space is going to do so    suppose if I have given initial point is    equal to 3 final point is equal to 7 and    then I have even 20 so what it will try    to do this so it will try to generate a    20 number of the rain last time in case    of a range function it was basically a    step size means here in this particular    case it was a step size means it will    start from here to point 5 plus step    size 3 plus the step size 3.5 and so on    but here this is not a step size this is    a basically a number of the element that    you are looking for in between these    scale so in between 3 to 7 it will try    to find out 20 number I can say that in    between any number in between even 0 to    1 you can generate a billion number you    can generate a infinite numbers over    here that is possible and it's possible    I will say so it is trying to generate a    number you will be able to find out that    starting from 3 ending till 7 and the    total number which it has generated is    equal to 20 if I wanted to generate    maybe a 200 number I can    generate a 200 number in between three    to seven itself as you can see so if I    have to generate our numbers in between    certain scale in that is I can try to    use a line space and it is going to    generate that mean number for me it's a    very very basic concept and again I like    up if I'm going to eat maybe like a    floating point number over here it is    going to work maybe if I'm going to be    maybe two point nine zero it is going to    work with someone morning    let's company define there is no meaning    of giving a step size equal to this one    what must I do I have passed it so this    is what you will be able to find out    guys so in case of a line space you can    try to generate any number in between    any of the number that you are going to    give and yes for sure it is going to    work for you now if you will look into    the parameter of this line space so    parameterize it takes like a starting    point end point and number of the    element that you are looking for suppose    if I am not giving the Samba so even in    this case it will generate some number    that number is equal to 50 so you are    not going to give a third argument so in    that case it will try to give you a    fifty number as per the mention argument    now so you can try to mention end point    is equal to false let's suppose if I am    going to mention end point is equal to    my default it will be true so false if I    am going to mention now what will happen    end point wise I have mentioned seven    point nine let's suppose so suppose if I    am NOT going to give end point or let's    suppose end point is equal to true so in    this case it will try to include a final    point as well means upper boundary as    well so here you will be able to find    out that seven point nine in my upper    boundary yes it is including it but if I    am going to make this things as a false    you will be able to find out that no it    is not going to include my final    boundary point just like a range and    arrange function so this is what a kind    of things that you will be able to get    out of this one so it's completely fine    guys so end point    now a red step so rate a step is equal    to by default it's equal to false now if    I'm going to make these things as a true    what is the meaning of that    so been able you are trying to when I    work basically like up here if I'm going    to write like a fight it means that I am    trying to generate five element type    element so this five element in between    these two this range this is the meaning    of this so I'm trying to generate    basically five element 1 2 3 4 5 5 11 I    am trying to generate in between these    two this skill so starting from a    three-team are seven point nine the    scale and try to generate now penny walk    it will try to generate five data so it    will equally divide this entire insert    into find space equally it will divide    now by default it is not going to give    you that after because if I'm trying to    generate maybe a data set on let's    suppose like different manner generate a    file data in between 1 to 10 so 5 date I    have managed in there so first data    could be one then two then four and then    six and then eight this is something    which I can write so if I'm trying to    generate like a fine red excluding the    upper bound so this is how we will be    able to do it    so everywhere it is trying to take some    kind of a constant is registered so if    you are going to make this register is    equal to true so it will try to tell you    that okay what is the difference between    this and this this and this    so difference between this and this is    the system different this and it says    this step so this is what it is going to    do by default it will be equal to false    now there is another argument that you    will be able to get over here so another    argument so no we have discussed on the    end part we have discussed in our type    so data type eyes you try to mention    anything suppose by default it's given    as an axis is equal to zero access you    go means no suppose if I am going to    mention axis one over here so here you    will be able to find out that based on    the let's suppose if I have given this    one    it takes access 0 by default and there    is no other parameter which is given    access 0 so if I have a    multi-dimensional array so in that case    yes it is going to give me access to    your access to but I just have a linear    are they don't that is there is no    meaning of getting access model because    I do not have any kind of a column I    just have a row over here now the next    thing that we are going to talk about is    so how we can create a different    different kind of arrays and how I will    be able to perform a reset population    because release of operation is very    much important the same operation is    always important and as a data scientist    you are going to use this greasy of    operation and degeneration or random    rate regeneration operation almost on a    daily basis so that belief I am going to    give NP dot j ER po n P dot zeros so    zeroes if I am going to give and then    what I can try to do this so I can try    to give maybe five over here so it is    going to generate a data with all the    day now with zeros I would say so again    I can try to give maybe our dimension    over here so maybe I can try to write    over here so five cross six in this case    it is going to generate five row six    column all the element it is going to    fill by this number of data let's    suppose if I am going to give maybe a to    cross by cross six it's a 3d data so    here you will be able to find out that I    have created a 3d data over here so - so    we have a basically like a to array to    array we have off side is 5 plus 6 so    this is having a factor of six size and    this is having up five to six size this    is how you are supposed to understand or    in a real time so you can try to    understand in this way so we have a data    1 data and we have another data just    behind off this data so if I'll talk    about the axis so axis wise suppose we    have our x axis we have our y axis and    we have a jet axis so suppose you factor    data array over here so this array is    nothing but that's a 2d array I have a    x-axis and a y-axis means I have a    column but if I am going to place    something over here just right    visualize it just like our pages which    is available inside your books so if you    will try to start folding your pages so    one by one one by one one by one so one    after another in pattern you will be    able to get other pages in a similar way    so if you will try to visualize these    things this is how you can visualize we    have one array and behind that we have    another array in depth so height width    and length you can consider or maybe x    axis y axis or z axis you can try to    consider so we have one array behind    another array so how many array we have    we have actually touring so this is one    array I would say this is one of the    array that I have at the second array    that we have is nothing but this one    second Harrod that we have is nothing    but this one just behind this so I have    window tell I have one array is this one    and another array is this one not random    so to what is a size of one array so    size of one array is five plus six so    size of the array which is available    behind this array is also five cross six    these things are important when you will    try to talk about the image processing    this things is very much important I    would say whenever we talk about regime    is processing when you will try to    understand a convolution neural network    so you will be able to find out that it    try to follow the same approach so this    is how you can understand a    multi-dimensional array over here I can    try to create maybe a four dimensional    array as well so here maybe I can try to    mention like two two over here and this    is nothing but a four dimensional array    it's completely fine it's a four    dimensional but visualization wise you    will not be able to visualize it for    sure there is no 4d which is available    in which we can visualize as of now just    till 3d I will be able to visualize it    even over here or even inside your like    visualization tool by using a macro tape    see ball or maybe a cufflinks this is    how I will be able to visualize it so    it's completely fine guys I am able to    create all the array with a zeros there    is something called as a NP dot once I    would say and it's same as I would say    like zeros instead of giving a zero it    tried to give you just up so we try to    give you    would say it tried to give you one so    like a three row and four column it is    trying to give it to you so we have like    a three row and we have a four column    over here this is the kind of array    which is created I can try to mention    true cross the cross for so it's    completely fine so two array we have to    already have over here of size three    cross food this is how you are supposed    to understand so one I really have to    another day so in a jet coordinate in a    jet axis I have another array in this    particular place so I can try to    generate like a array which ones array    with zeros there is no such array which    is possible with twos so there is no two    which is available I can maybe try to    like a created maybe I can try to    perform this operation so twos and four    threes I can create it just by    performing this kind of the broadcasting    operation now the another thing that I    will be talking about is so if I am    going to call NV dot dot TM PTY empty so    if I am going to pass maybe four cross    five over here I will be able to get    some random number in case of empty now    if I am going to print this mg off maybe    a zero of a zero I just wanted to show    you like what is the exact element which    is available well over here you will be    able to get three now if I am going to    execute yeah completely fine so in your    case when you will try to execute a same    thing so sometime you will end up    getting some time you will end up    getting maybe are three four five six on    some time you will be end up getting a    very small number I would say so or    sometimes you will be able to get maybe    zeros here you will be able to find out    that I am able to get a very small    number in to the power minus 311 which    is a very very small number which I am    able to get so empty is nothing but it    just try to give you or it just try to    create some kind of a random element and    it will try to give almost element close    to zero most of the time most of the    time I'm not saying that all the time    but most of the time if we try to give    you a helmet close to zero in some of    your system you will end up getting zero    as well that is called as a empty array    I would say empty means a value    just close to a zero now the next thing    which I will be talking about is called    as a MP dot e ye I do so I is nothing    but itself identity matrix I think in a    childhood we talked about it man and    standard so we generally talk about    matrixes in which we will be having a 1    1 1 in a diagonal element as an idol    elements so if I have to like I want you    to get like a 1 1 1 and if I'm trying to    do a matrix multiplication it should    give me only one that kind of a matrix    is called as a identity matrix and if    you are going to create my data matrix    identities will always be a square    matrix S five matrix means number of row    and number of columns should always be    same that is called as a square matrix    so a greedy matrix will be like a for    sure it will be a spy matrixes and    whenever you are trying to perform a    matrix multiplication or matrix    computation so it is going to give you    one so it is possible to create IMD    matrix of any dimension so I can try to    give four I just have to give like a one    element one input over here because row    and column will be same because I dream    it this will be a square matrixes so you    will be able to find out that all the    diagonal elements are one now if you    will try to perform a calculation on a    determinant of this particular matrixes    you will be able to get one as a final    outcome it's completely fine    so this is where or this is how you will    be able to create I would say like    identity matrix s again these things are    very much important when it comes to our    data or matrix multiplication because    image processing or similar processing    or like the training a model is nothing    but it's a matrix multiplication if you    are going to use like a neural network    it's nothing but it's just a matrix    multiplication in itself with    derivatives so it's completely fine this    is what you will be able to get now the    another one another thing that I can    talk about is called as a log phase so    let's try to talk about that what is a    meaning of a longest phase what is a    meaning of a line space and how this    thing's is actually going to    so fine guys I think I talked about    Linus face now this time so let's try to    understand that how I will be able to    get a logarithmic of the data set again    so it's nothing new or nothing fancy I    would say so it's almost same as a line    space that we have discussed so I can    try to call n P dot log space so alone g    space now what I can do is I can try to    maybe give up the range in between 5.6    27.8 and maybe i wanted to generate 6    element so what will happen is it is    trying to generate our 6 element and it    is not going to give you an element it    is going to give you basically a    logarithmic of all the element which it    had generated so far so forth so this is    what this particular operation is going    to give you eyes so it's completely fine    a lot of space is almost close to a line    space the only thing is line space just    give me element directly whereas long    space is going to give you a logarithmic    again you have a control so if you    wanted to change maybe a like a base of    the log you will be able to change it by    default base will be equal to 10 let's    suppose I wanted to perform on the    calculation with respect to base is    equal to 2 I'm assuming that all of you    are aware about a base so on base 2 this    is the logarithmic of each a my data it    is going to generate it's completely    fine now what I can do is so there is a    function I would say there is a function    call as a range function so let's try to    understand that what is a meaning of a    erage function and like yeah in each    function we already discuss so let's try    to understand that how we can try to    generate a random number so I can try to    call maybe like numpy again this    function these are the few of the    function which we are going to use on a    daily basis so I can try to call ra n DF    d om random and then after doing this    random so maybe I can try to call rent    so if I'm going to call numpy dot random    dot ran and then even    to pass a dimension so it is going to    create an array it is going to create an    array of size 4 cross 5 for Row 5 column    and it is going to give you a random    data it is going to give you our and    Amina so every time whenever I am going    to secure it it is going to give me a    random data there is a procedure there    is a way by which I will be able to get    a same data and you will be able to get    a same data every time even if I am    going to call a random there is    something called as a c-corporation so I    will talk about that then we talk about    that operation but yeah when time will    go so here I am trying to generate    basically a data of for cross file let's    suppose photos 5 minutes I have 20 data    let's suppose if I wanted to store this    data inside a variable M it's completely    fine I can store it and then I am trying    to generate M over here now let's    suppose if I wanted to resale or I    wanted to change our dimension of this    data so from 2d to 3d or maybe 2 1 D if    I wanted to generate or maybe I wanted    to reshape this data into some other    same so how I will be able to do it I    have in total 20 element so I can try to    call n dot resale over here and then    resell vise what I can do is I have n    total 20 element 4 plus 5 is equal to 20    so I have to give over here a dimension    which will be like a multiplicate so if    I am going to multiply these two    arguments it should always give me a 20    otherwise it is going to give you an    issue so maybe I can try to convert my    data into 10 plus 2 it's completely fine    so 10 row 2 column it's the same data    it's exact same data I am just trying to    perform what reshaping operation maybe I    can try I to perform into our twenty    cross 120 cross one so it's completely    fine I'm able to get that number miss    you now that's suppose if I wanted to    convert this data into five crores for    five gospel it's completely fine it is    able to convert this data so previous    one was photos five no itself five cross    four so you will be able to reshape your    dataset in any dimension to any    dimension there won't be any restriction    and there    any difficulties you will be able to    find out and the shaping of the data is    very much important again these are like    a few the function that you are going to    use very frequently as a data scientist    now so m dot reshape and I guess I am    able to like perform this reshaping    operation five row and then four columns    in which I am able to reshape my data    let's suppose I wanted to be say potata    and I have given the chain over here so    maybe I can try to give any kind of a    number in this particular place it is    trying to take ten costume I can give    any number over here doesn't matter at    all so in general you will be able to    find out that people used to give minus    one now it's not like minus one you    should use all the time you can use any    negative number you can try this out you    can use any negative number it's    completely fine now what this negative    number does so if you have already    defined one dimension if you want your    system to understand other dimension it    will be able to understand it looking    the rectifying so one is ten which has    been given and total number of breda is    equal to 20 so 10 cross 20 is a so 10    plus 2 is equal to 20 so it will title    like a understand minus 1 is equal to 20    so any negative number you can try to    eat over here it will try to behave into    a similar way it's not going to change    you can try to write a minus like some    data even over here at one dimension at    least you should provide see it has    converted my entire data set into two    cross ten so as you can see so I have    like that two data set and inhibited as    it I have a ten element basically so    this is how it will be able to perform    our transformations of the data into any    shape to any safe now let's suppose if I    am going to give maybe a 10 cross 3 it    is going to give you issue saying that    no I am NOT able to understand this for    you know say that you have given I just    have a 20 element so whatever dimension    that you are going to give it to me that    should be a verification of like it    should be it should always give you a 20    number if you are going to multiply like    a row and a column so this is what you    will be    to get over here guys in case of a    reshape operation now so I was talking    about our NP dot random dot align    function so what I will do is I will try    to call some other function over here so    let's suppose if I'm trying to call    around m and then if I am going to    qualify across six even in this case you    will be able to get a data there is a    very small differences you will be able    to find out between random and uh random    so if I'll talk about a rank function    over here so you will be able to find    out that it is going to give me always a    uniform distribution there is something    called a normal distribution there is    something called as a standard normal    distribution so in our statistics class    I'll talk about like basically those    things I think I will start a community    edition of the statuses classes as well    it starts in from a building which has    been required for the data scientist so    in that one I will be talking about our    bell-shaped curve I am talking about a    normal distribution I will talk about a    standard normal distribution I will be    talking about like how we try to    calculate like a y-axis by using a    normal distribution formula 1 by root of    2 pi Rho e to the power minus 1 by 2    into X minus mu by Rho of square so how    I will be able to I will generally I    used to derive these things and then I    used to talk about like what is the    significance of normally distributed    data what is the significance of a    standard normal distribution how I will    be able to convert normal distribution    into a standard normal distribution many    things we used to talk about what is the    meaning of like when we say into a    standard normal distribution mu is equal    to 0 the standard deviation is equal to    1 so everything I will be talking about    not here but into a statistics class    here you should understand that rand    function always try to give you a    uniform distribution means if you will    try to find out a mu of the data mean of    the data it will not be equal to 0 all    the time but at the same point of time    if you will try to find out mu of this    data that i've generated so you will be    able to find out so mu will be closed -    closed - I would say 0 means average    close to a Geo for this pertinent data    if you will start increasing a data size    it will start tending towards a zero in    terms of a mean or in terms of a mu so    fine so this always had to generate a    standard normal distribution now if you    will look into the definition standard    normal distribution did not in fact    generate whereas ran in function so rent    in generates a standard normal    distribution data Rand N and only rand    function if I'll talk about rand    function at from strata generate a    uniform distribution so fine guys again    apart from that so I have like a numpy    dot Rand int int I can try to give like    you gamma eight I can try to give and    then what I can do is I can try to write    like a dimension I've lost six over here    now in number I dot random dot okay    so here you will be able to find out    that there is a function called as R and    again in case of a Rand fortune in case    of around n functions always try to    generate what it all hydrogenate a    floating-point number    suppose if I wanted to generate only a    integer in between some certain ranges I    would say so yes I will be able to do    that so in between three to eight it had    generated thirty element so again there    will be a repetition because it's just    your integer in between three to eight    but it will try to give you an integer    based on the dimension that you have    given over here so this is what guys you    will be able to find out insider randant    I think we talked about re safe    operation so reshape is a basic    operation that you should know at any    point of time again in terms of for    indexing and slicing suppose if I have a    array let's suppose if I am going to    store this array inside a so he is    nothing but this element that I have has    an array now let's suppose if I wanted    to    access an element out of this particular    array so how I will be able to access    element out of this particular array so    I can try to write maybe a zero and if    I'm going to write zero I will be able    to get a judo throw that is completely    fine maybe if I can try to write zero to    a five so let's see what will happen so    whenever I have written zero to five    well let's see I am going to write here    - so you will be able to find out that    in case of a zero to two so it is giving    me a zero throw it is giving me a first    row excluding second row and I can try    to write zero of 2 over here you will be    able to find out that it is trying to do    a slicing operations and it is trying to    give me only this one so means 0 1 0 1    this is the meaning of this one so if I    have some data set even if I have a 3d    array I will be able to extract and    later I just have to write another axis    over here and it's completely fine    there won't be an issue I will be given    to get up data set very easily so this    is what happens guys I would say in    terms of for data slicing operation now    whatever operations that we have    discussed so far so for everything is    applicable even over here everything bit    by bit    everything is available even in this    particular please now what I can do is    so maybe I have array a over here now I    can try to write a greater than 5 so if    I am going to write a greater than 5 so    whatever element and wherever data I    have so if it is greater than 5 it is    going to give me true otherwise it is    going to give me false oh yes 705 so it    is giving me true over here rest of the    element will be equal to false now if I    am going to pass this data inside an    array itself what will happen it is    going to give me only those data which    is going to validate with this    particular condition so you can try to    write any kind of a condition as well    and for sure    you will be able to get a data based on    your given condition so it's completely    fine so I can just write a condition    just like a    and then I will be able to get a data    very easily now let's suppose if I    wanted to perform some kind of    assignment operation so a of maybe like    a 0 of 0 so I can try to perform    assignment operation as well so it's    completely fine if I am going to print a    as you can see on a 0 of 0 location it    has replaced this particular element so    if this proves that array is basically a    like a mutable element now so let's    suppose if I am going to perform or    let's suppose if I am going to create    some kind of an array M is equal to MP    array list of    so this is my M now I will do is I am    trying to get n na n is what okay so I    have basically I get two array over here    now if I am going to perform a M plus    one operation in plus n operation so in    this case what will happen so it will    try to perform this addition operation    it will try to perform this addition    operation index wise it is going to    perform element or like Windex wise    element operations over here now if I    will talk about M minus n so again index    wise it will try to perform the    operation let's suppose index of one    element is different and another element    is different in this case it is going to    give you an issue saying that ok so I    was expecting this and you have given me    some other elements so make sure that    whenever you are going to like a perform    this kind of operation so your array    dimension is always same now if I'll    talk about like M into M into and so    again this is not a matrix    multiplication this is basically a index    wise operation simple so index to index    it will try to like a perform this    multiplication operation so M cross n so    6 7 2 3 4 into 4 5 into 5 so yes    sushi 7 2 3 4 plus 4 I went to find and    so on so this is basically our index    wise operation it is trying to perform    matrix multiplication is completely    different for example let's suppose I    have one matrix M 1 on like I have an    element called as 0 1 2 3 this is the    element that I have then again I have    another matrix is M 2 let's suppose and    I am trying to perform like 2 3 1 8 this    is the element that we have M 1 and M 2    now if I am looking for a matrix    multiplication what I should    in that case I can try to imagine like    this with this so I can multiply 0 into    2 plus 1 into 1 then this with this I    can try to so this I will try to    multiply with this particular element so    it's completely fine so 0 into 2 and 1    into 1 I can try to multiply as you can    see that it's a 2 cross 2 element it's a    2 cross 2 element then I can try to    multiply this with this 1 so 0 into 3    plus 1 into 8 now so I can't element    like this with this one again so 2 into    1 plus 3 into 20 - 2 so here 2 into 2    plus 3 into 1 and then 2 into 3 plus 3    into 8 now if you will try to solve it    so 0 into 2 0 you will be able to get 1    over here and then 3 into 0 is equal to    0 you will be able to get 8 over here    and then 2 into 2 is equal to 4 plus 3    is equal to 7 and then 2 cross 3 cross 2    is equal to 6 and 8 into 3 is equal 24    so it will be equal to 30 so this is a    final matrix multiplication that you    will be able to receive now let's try to    do the same thing over here so here I    can try to write M 1 and M 1 is nothing    but so same element I am going to take    so now I got a double RA Y and I'm going    to take basically just off list so that    I will be able to convert it so do you    know comma 1 and then I can try to take    maybe like 2 comma 3 this is m1 now if    I'll try to print m1 this how it looks    like 0 comma 1 2 comma 3 same element    then if I have to calculate or if I have    to create maybe are empty m2 over here    so M 2 so m2 is nothing but so numpy dot    a double re ye array and then inside    that so I can try to create maybe our 2    3 so 2 comma 3 and 1/8 so I can try to    like output I would say 1 comma 8 so    it's completely fine M 2 is nothing but    this one now I don't want to do em into    so M 1 into M 1 into into M 2 if I am    trying to do m1 into m2 so I am able to    get 0 3 to 24 but no that is not an    answer which I have received by doing my    manual calculation so what I can do is I    can try to do em one at the rate and two    now you will be able to find out that    whatever manual calculation which I have    done and whatever result which I am able    to secure over here this result one    eight seven thirty I am able to get    exactly the same result by doing a    matrix multiplication so into is not a    symbol for a matrix multiplication into    is a symbol for index wise    multiplication if you have to do a    Marissa multiplication in that case you    can try to use at the rate symbol and in    this way you will be able to get a    matrix multiplication I am assuming that    you all know the rule of am interest    multiplication so suppose if I have like    M cross n matrix s and n cross P matrix    s so this two things will be same this    one should be same so if this one is    same then only you will be able to    perform a matrix multiplication means a    column of a first matrix and a row of a    second matrix s should always be same if    it is not same you will not be able to    perform a matrix multiplication if try    this out and the final matrix that you    will be able to get this is equal to M    cross P so I already had 2 cross 2 and 2    cross 2 so yes 2 is equal to 2 that is    completely fine finally I will be able    to get a matrix of to cross - so like a    2 cross 2 so yes I am able to get a    matrix of 2 cross 2 over here so    remember always guys like how matrix    multiplication happens    what does not come as a matrix    multiplication that is very much    important for you now addition    subtraction multiplication division well    suppose I wanted to give a power so m1    is a element which I have created now so    I wanted to give a power is equal to 2    so you will be able to find out that    this is the original matrix S now if I    have done a power W static miss power so    it is going to give like a 0 into 0 1    into 1 so 1 into 1 is equal to 1 2 into    2 is equal to 4 to be about 2 to the    power 2 is equal to 9 so yes it's a 9 so    this is what is the meaning of a power    that you will be able to give power wise    either try to keep her you can try to    use a power function as well it will do    the same thing so maybe they try to call    everyone and then you can try to give    maybe a 2 over here you will be able to    get a same result so both way it's    completely fine you can try to give a    power power - it can be loot as well    there won't be an issue at all that you    are going to face in any cases now so    let's sigh to perform some kind of    operation so here I am going to create    like let's suppose M I am going to    create NP dot j e r OS zeroes and I can    give 5 comma 6 or maybe like 3 comma 4    let's suppose so it's completely fine I    am able to get a data or like I am able    to get all the zeroes as 3 comma 4 so    like a three row and a four column and    you will to get it that is completely    fine this is what expectation is now if    I am going to perform like a M plus M    plus 1 or M plus 2 so it will try to add    this element on I can do a subtraction    as well I can do multiplication division    or any kind of arithmetic operation    there won't be an issue so I can try to    perform this kind of operation that    won't be any kind of an issue that you    are going to face that is completely    fine but this is called as a    element-wise    broadcasting operation means with    speak to every elements I'm trying to    broadcast mine a data that's I'm going    to add to in every element what if I'm    looking for a robust podcasting    operation or if I'm looking for a column    wise podcasting operation what I should    do in that case let's suppose so let's    try to perform this operation so I am    going to create m1 over here or let's    suppose N 1 I am going to create N 1 is    nothing but so MP dot a double RA Y and    in a single row I have basically like a    four-element    so maybe I can try to give 1 comma 2    comma 3 comma 4 maybe - it's fine if I    am going to execute it so it should work    fine so bracket and here it should be    bracket so fine here I have N 1 now what    is so I have N 1 as this one and I have    M as this so this one is the element now    what if if I am going to do n plus and 1    what will happen in this case let's    understand this you will be able to find    out that this time when I am trying to    provide a entire number of the data is    equal to total number of for data which    I have inside a single row so you know    first row I have 1 3 4 - it's completely    fine    so I'm going to try to provide this data    I'm trying to provide this data I am    trying to add these things with this one    so it is trying to perform a row wise    broadcasting operation last time when I    have just added one element so it was    trying to do element wise not casting    this time so when I'm trying to like add    this Plus this so it is trying to do a    row wise broadcasting operations by    default but customers it is trying to    perform the similar operation so 1 3 4 2    1 3 4 2 1 3 4 2 it has added with    respect to this one now    what if if I wanted to perform a column    wise podcast or what if if I have like a    more number of element over here in this    case what will happen there will be an    issue so if you are trying to do a    broadcasting operation so it will make    sure that save is always same if save is    not same for show    you will not be able to get out come so    fine sape is same now let's suppose what    if if I wanted to do a broadcasting    operation along with a row along with    the room if I were to do a broadcasting    operation so is it possible cause this    is that like a this is like horizontal    broadcasting operation suppose if I    wanted to do a vertical broadcasting    operations in that case how I will be    able to do it so if I have to perform    this kind of operation so maybe I can    try to create an umpire dot array and I    can try to give maybe like 3 comma 4    comma 5 that's what I mentioned it's a    three data set is available in one    single column or vertical like a way so    if I am going to exist and I can do this    kind of operations and let's suppose if    I am going to store these things into n    2 so n 2 is nothing but this one if I am    going to do like M plus n 2 it is going    to give me an issue because by default    this is nothing but itself horizontal    array array along X exists is equal to 0    so axis is equal to 0 along with that it    always try to create an array so what I    should do in that case maybe I can try    to do what transpose operation so I can    try to call doc T now so if I am going    to like    perform a transpose operation so what    what you have to do is just try to    perform a transpose operation and by    doing this transpose operation you will    be like able to transpose a data or you    will be able to rotate a data so make    sure that you are going to take our    two-dimensional data over here so as you    can see that it is able to perform a    transpose operation a vertical like    operation it is able to do and now if I    am going to perform a broadcast    operation so 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5    along with a vertical column so it is    able to and it or it is able to    broadcast it so this is something called    as a broadcasting and this is how    broadcasting is going to happen actually    so you will be able to do element or    broadcasting you will be able to do row    wise broadcasting because many times you    will try to face this kind of pressure    like I have to normalize my data I have    to advise my data    maybe I have to perform a similar kind    of operation on a millions of arrays at    a time a millions of the data at a time    so these are the broadcasting operation    which always like it's a handy operation    so you will try to do it and in that way    you will be able to perform a data    manipulation so vertically if you wanted    to add something you can add it    horizontally if you wanted to add    something yes you will be able to and it    there won't be any kind of issue that    you are going to face now what I can do    is I think try to maybe like a create an    array and NP dot random dot ranch and I    can try to give maybe a dimension of the    array 4 comma 5 so it's completely fine    so it is able to generate a 4 comma 5    random data then I can try to do maybe a    reshaped over here ress jpe    we save and for power 5 so i wanted to    cover in to 1 and costly so now 10 low    two columns it has generated some other    data and then i am trying to just    release a pitch it's completely fine now    what i will do is i will try to like her    take this as a and I can try to I can    try to like generate another random data    this is like I am I have and M is equal    to this one I can try to generate maybe    M 1 for sure it's a random data so it is    going to be different m1 Arjun M I have    generated so it's completely fine both    wait a sec is different now so if I    wanted to perform a square root    operation for all the elements what I    can do is I can try to call numpy dot    dot s q RT and m1 so in this case it    will try to perform or if you try to    give you a square root of every element    which is a playable inside m1 this is    what it does square root now so let's    suppose if you have to calculate our    exponent of every element so he X P and    you can try to mention m1 over here on    any matrixes this is nothing but it's an    exponent of the m1 data set that we have    created    the exponent so these are the function    which is available I'm just trying to    talk about our function over here    nothing else maybe if you want it to get    a log of every data set log so 10 log to    whatever you want so log of M 1 yes you    will be able to get along as well after    you dataset now let's suppose if you    wanted to like you have M 1 and you have    M as well if you have M as well over    here now let's suppose you wanted to    perform our division operation and you    want it to print like you want it to    print I would say a remainder so you can    try to type M and M 1 over here you will    be able to you will be able to find out    that it is giving me a remainder if    would does what so f would always try to    give up remainder let's suppose if I am    going to divide 10 by 3 what will be our    remainder    the amenda will be equal to 1 if I'm    going to divide 5 by 2 what will the    remainder matter will be equal to 1 or 7    by 5 if I am going to divide the matter    will be equal to 2 so this is just going    to give you a remainder    it will either divide this by this and M    by M 1 and then whatever will be the    remainder it will try to give you a    remainder as simple as that so this is    how this mathematical function is going    to work with respect to an array and    this is what I was supposed to discuss I    would say guys in today's class so keep    practicing I would say all those things    in a next class so I will talk about a    visualization so which is nothing but a    math problem    cufflinks Seabourn plotly so I'm going    to cover these libraries in terms of a    visualization you will be able to    visualize your data set I will talk    about how this visualization is    different from a visualization that we    used to do into a data analytics tool    like a power bi a chaplain or maybe W or    maybe a QlikView or something like that    so this is all about numpy now in numpy    there are thousands and thousands of    function which is available you should    not know about all the function these    are the basic function that should know    you know very first place    for sure you should practice all of    those functions that I've mentioned over    here and yeah after that for sure you    will be able to pick and choose any kind    of example or any any kind of use cases    and you will be able to debug those use    cases and you will be able to perform    all sort of data manipulation of data    addition subtraction or matrix    operations any kind of a matrix    operation or any kind of array operation    that you are looking for yes it is    possible to perform all of those are the    operation so now like a what I will do    is so I will try to take some of the    questions I think we have already    answered many questions like from our    side in your Q&amp;A session so I will try    to take some of the live question from    here and if you have any kind of    combination combination you can try this    out by yourself and then we can go ahead    so fine guys I'm going to unmute couple    of you one by one you can start asking    question in our what I have a 2d array    it is a three four five six seven eight    and six seven nine the one that you have    used in example and is you have array    inside an array right okay so tell me    that you have just anything else and one    two three    okay fines people fighting and then like    one two three    fine and one more one more one more    airing okay so okay one more array you    want me to you okay yes now if I give    like the shape of this one okay this is    giving me some like different kind of    output I could not understand somewhat    of this so see this is my array and    right now if you are trying to give    shape right now what is the meaning of    shape say it means number of rows number    of column right here    so can I say that I have basically this    array and 0    one two do you know 1 2 so 3 cos 3    define the n-dimensional like I want to    convert it to attending like ending    equal to 10 you wanted to convert into    10 dimension right see same this depend    and I mention is different so suppose if    I am going to keep n dim over here D    lasso n dimension over here like so now    it will look like this one okay now you    this is the something that you are    looking for right okay so now C is going    to read this one so save means dimension    what is a total number of dimension that    you are given so certain of our    dimension is equal to 10 that we have    given and I will try to take my previous    array as well let's suppose so I will    try to take my previous array as well so    this one and let me I can name these    things as a n 1 over here so now N 1 is    this and here if I am going to print    n1 dot in 1 dot shape so it is trying to    give me a total number of row and put a    number of columns now what is the    meaning of total number of row and total    number of column so here can I say that    this is a two dimensional array it's a    two dimensional right if you will try to    print a dimension so what is the    dimension that is going to return can I    say that n 1 . + 1 . n dim it is going    to give it to two dimension now what is    the meaning of two dimension to    dimension means x coordinate and y    coordinate can say that x axis and y    axis so i will be able to represent my    array over here this is the meaning of    this already it's already what is the    meaning of three dimension the dimension    means i am trying to expand these things    into a gel axis as well right so it's    since i'm trying to add summary behind    array so one we have one array so just    try to understand in this way so what is    the meaning of three dimensions so    meaning of the dimension is nothing but    suppose i have this tiny night so I have    wandering I have wandering over here    right now if I'm going to check another    page over here so I am trying to get one    or behind another away right this is    called a theory so this one you want    punish people let me just have one D and    then behind    3d not tendon is one practical attendee    you will not be able to visualize it    right so 10 dimension is 1 so I have in    a virtual space in a virtual space I    have basically these many number of the    dimension these mean number of the    dimension I have now when I say what to    do over here but I say this is a 2d    array so with the help of x and y    coordinate I will be able to represent    it when I will try to say these things    as a 3d array it means in out breath in    in like an inert towards a jet axis also    I have some data so when I say 10    dimension so I can say that even into a    10 dimension I have some kind of a data    that's the region so you will be able to    get basically 10 element 10 I will miss    let's one by one let's try to understand    it suppose if I'm going to like create    this array    n1 and if I am going to reshape n1 in    this space so n1 dot please say I would    say into 1 Cross 3 cross 3 now what is    the meaning of this can I say that it    has converted these things into write    again if I am going to convert these    things one pass one pass body    knightly what is the meaning of 1 Cross    1 Cross 1 for 3 cos 3 1 cross means I    have basically an array and inside that    I have a array base in your 3 cos 3 what    if if I am going to convert these things    I have total like a 9 number of elements    let's suppose I am going to give this as    3 and this as 1 Cross 3 now what    happened you will be able to find out    that I have basically three array what    is the meaning of this theory I have    right means I have basically three array    of size 1 Cross 3 right I have basically    three array this is one array this is    another array several comma this is a    another array and what is the size of    every array 1 cos 3 right oh if you are    going to give a dimension so for sure    whenever you will try to print a save    right so same wise it is going to give    you 9 element itself you can write a    multiply everything    it will be nice means helmet has not    changed right the only thing is so it is    trying to add a timing    in that one so it is well previously    like we had a two dimension it has added    a bracket means it will keep on    increasing our dimension into a virtual    space that is a meaning of these things    it's exactly like a same thing I got    three dimensional two dimensional maybe    one D we used to create is it making    sense now    7 2 1 4 then we have taken a matrix    column wise addition sorry we have done    the conversion see a reshaping so each    suppose I have like a this one is a data    night and let's suppose if I am trying    to find out maybe let's suppose I am    going to perform this operation so    stop and again    okay so two four five of him okay do you    get oh yeah we have like a n2 and it's    completely fine and now this is how this    data set is now if I try to check a    shape of this data so let's suppose even    trying to check a shape of this data the    same one plus three right now what I    will do is I will try to do a reshape    and these shape means so I can try to    convert this thing to do 3 cross 1 right    already    I will paint these things so can I say    whatever I was able to achieve with the    help of again I am trying to achieve    exactly same thing with help of this one    and further if I wanted to do some kind    of processing I will be able to do it so    let's try to generate em over here done    so we reduce it object resume tomorrow    comma 3 or gonna basically going to give    just a vector over here you are not    going to give an element inside an    element now let's try to understand what    happens internally so suppose if I have    given this element right now if you will    try to check a shape of this one say is    nothing but 3 it is trying to give you    now if you will try to check basically    like n dot dim of these things so we    have like a n 2 so n 2 dot M di M so    basically it's a one dimension one    dimension is what so you are trying to    you are trying to add some element so    what is M so can I say that N is a two    dimension right and n is what n is one    dimension in one dimension you will not    be able to perform a array    multiplication operation addition    operation division operation subtraction    operation different dimension shape is    different thing so she buys if I have a    shape like a shape is like a dimension    in dimension is same because see what    happens is dilation can I say dimension    of M is equal to 2 only dimension of    this entire array is equal to 2 or e    right and even if I'll try to perform    this operation for dimension of even    this one is too can I say that nation is    too so shape is different but can I say    that dimension is same yes so whenever    you're trying to do our data addition    operation of multiplication operation or    division operation or any kind of    manipulation operation in terms of our    element fixes make sure that dimension    should always be same say is different    it's completely fine but dimension    should not generation means x y&amp;z    coordinates in between you're trying to    do some kind of multiplication so that    should not be change at all and that's    the region so I have cut what are those    things into a like in dimension and then    I was trying to perform this addition    operation Virginia and there may still    be ship level 3 cross 1 car yes it will    be able to change the dimension for sure    so reshape is received is nothing but    Saudi ship always gets applied on any    kind of other rate so you can try to    reshape it from anything to anything    Pascal carry shaker notably children    exactly see whenever this is what I was    trying to explain your last case right    suppose if I have this kind of metrics    right as of now what is the dimension of    this matrix what is the dimension of M 3    dimension dimension also D 2 mu T right    it's a 2d basically to miss exercise    coordinate basically right now let's    suppose if I am trying to apply    basically Arisa function so can I say    that I can convert    I can change a dimension as well right    so maybe I can write apply V shape this    is AP over here are Chrisman reshape and    maybe I can try to give so one cross to    cross total number of element is 0.23 is    equal to L right so maybe I can give 6    over here or maybe I don't want to give    anything in that case I will be minus 1    can I say that I have change the    dimension by doing a recent operation    yes exactly right yes by doing or even I    can try to change these things into 10    dimension for dimension but what I'm    trying to say is so whenever you are    trying to do some kind of a primitive    operation with respect to our array so    dimension should always be same the data    element or like the matrixes on the    array that you have taken then only it    will be able to perform those kind of    operations you can try to    perform a matrix multiplication or    addition operation with a element which    is having a different dimension    physically damages should be same same    could be anything    generally people gets confused I hope    you find instead that damage should be    same and the same should set can be    different sometimes people buy    conditions same as a dimensional    dimension is safe so make sure that you    understand emissions animation and then    you can try to check in this way yeah    thank you sir NP dot line space may okay    NP dot line is base in P dot line space    so I just wanted okay what do you want    me to give three seven seven okay and    any any flooding number fine any protein    number you wanted me to give okay yeah    as possible think so so what is the    third element    no let's just try to understand this    upper angle function it is not going to    give you like an issue that is going to    give you warning right now why does    given your warning if you will try to    understand this particular signature of    the function so you will be able to find    out that it always look for starting    point it always look for my stopping    point agree and always look for the    number means here the number of the item    that you are trying to generate now    number of item you have given as point    five for five    do you think any item in this entire    world exists as a point four five oh    yeah according right never happen that    you'll ask you okay fine give me a    hundred rupees so what you will do even    just like so and so like if I ask you to    find give me one point four five rupees    at one point four five movies so you    will give me one rupees and then like I    you will try to tour this one Lupe's and    then give it to me no right    oh that's not yeah yeah the same thing    gets a buy dinner over here yeah thank    you    yeah next question please    okay fine guys I think like we are done    for today    all right so we have discussed this    numpy things done by is actually very    much important in terms of all    mathematical operation and you will not    be able to understand as significance of    numpy unless and until you are not into    a redesigns or machine learning or deep    learning because like if you are into    this area for sure you will keep on    using a number and I is like a some kind    of a things which should always help you    out like to debug your code or to    understand the entire neural network and    how training happens for is going to    bill the model what is a kernel inside    that one how like a data is trying to    calculate it how data is going to like a    bill which is trying to understand the    pattern data so everything everything    you will be able to understand and    everything happens inside and you'll    network in terms of India rain itself in    the area or number metrics on itself    so just try to understand this part and    again one more information like this    number is not only this much number    itself is a very huge package very use    package so there are thousands and    thousands of a function which is    available but at the same point of a    time you should not know all those    functions it's completely fine on a    requiring basis you will try to explore    you in tagalog but these are the basic    function which you should practice and    mission which you should know we have    all we are going to give you I think we    have already uploaded up and aspect    assignment and we are going to update on    my practice plus number assignments both    of these things we are going to update    and make sure that you are going to    complete your assignments and you try to    complete all of those the practice    session that we have given you probably    by tomorrow it will be updated and I    think we have already updated up and    asked so keep doing those things and    keep practicing those things next class    I will talk about matplotlib Seabourn    and cufflinks and plotly so till then so    thank you so much you learn in this    class and see you again in the next    class with that every day a night ahead  ]\n",
